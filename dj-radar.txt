dj radar hello applause well call turntablist yeah guess instrument turntable difference scratch dj turntablist work follow direction think difference dj obviously play people music think turntablist us record make music kind flip mind type thing arizona yeah many dj come arizona well much z trip partner blowing lot dj phoenix really popular start drummer real instrument player start real young probably like seven year old play drum still play drum pretty much every day good rhythm practice study music well yeah go school snare drummer percussion player mostly go school first contact dj transition drummer turntablist think make sense first start mean get appeal rhythmically like could turntable much drum stuff start think really caught rhythmically could rhythmic possibility kind endless pitch endless combination come like rhythmically melodically capture really hone never thought would take far mess around bedroom different stuff turntable come new scratch amaze dynamic instrument yeah especially record since play instrument like yeah pretty much limited though really like harmonic instrument play chord anything like lot melodic stuff recognise rhythmic instrument start make music one thing scratch one thing make music scratch everybody like scratch drummer know kind feel go wicki wakka wick make actual music think get methodical get really plan start really get think mean multi track stuff day long layer stuff like methodical make track usually write everything first write scratch actually play right get far turntable score stuff like help organise idea put paper cause played learn play piano learn look note stuff kind apply turntable try take methodical approach traditional approach like something would learn school something like learn always make sense way like learn scratch would listen jam master jay people backcash money jazzy jeff listen mixtapes see video play lot get tire rewinding time would write em would em right front would practice seem learn faster way always rewinding tape try figure way start write stuff see rhythmically still even analyze get together q bert analyze lot stuff must hard write q bert sometimes yeah really tricky combination get interest technique retrain whole hand really ambidextrous cross fader like people would tendency always demonstrates inward scratch movement turntable stuff offbeat really retrain whole hand like one thing pat head pat head rub tummy time really start write lot easy figure approach turntable back question write music think real methodical like want get realise real limitation turntable also lot variation far like lot pitch stuff turntable three note range technics sl third note little flat three note really work newer turntable like pdx numark really octave range maybe octave half ultra pitch could really go percent work octave half least twelve solid note work lot harmonic stuff start apply notation stuff like really lot write whole melody around go back multi track protools lay bassline write know say whole track bassline like make basslines start stack many different way either start melody lay drum track hi hat like tss tss tss tss write scratch melodic instrument say trumpet write note well yeah get think like think like different texture instrument like want trumpet sound go score trumpet try find sound kind range octave map real easy come song instead go try stuff multitracking see come methodical like write everything always head first tool help get write scratch write rhythm pattern course note sometimes even way play record yeah lot accent lot different really creep new idea lot stuff create actually town five six hundred year ago lot technique start able score violin concerto start much history rome amaze walk around museum see original score see first piano built country alone much musical history really inspire know get respect cause tradition music pretty much start apply technique even master use tradional music apply non traditional instrument pretty much yeah write rhythm create anything new maybe create new like new scratch something do violin do piano go articulation part already create already system tool apply system scratch right lot technique already document like trill something like see dj demonstrates trill hard trill glissando kind stuff turntable violin take lot note violin score string stuff adapt turntable adapt trumpet stuff lot scratch like go doo wit doo wit doo wit demonstrates move record backwards forward whilst bring volume move record back forward trumpet notation call doo wit like doo wit pitch kind go go demonstrates pitch motion hand thing go doo wit show turntable one articulation already create doo wit demonstrates cut hear pitch go doo wit doo wit thing trumpet play make sound mouth call doo wit unique trumpet articulation adapt thing help think quicker get paper already see sound like think lot people something visual learn lot easy imagine learn piano listen would incredibly hard notation try figure come standardize system turntable cause know people visual learn faster visually people learn faster listen stuff like combine teach like learn piano process go learn lot faster visual representation like go hand go hand like rhythmically know th note th note whole note start apply stuff visual representation real easy figure like aww q bert write show student exactly go actually another thing right exactly least something build go cause rhythmic combination really lot style go come could rhythm q bert everyone go play differently beautiful thing music always unique performance endless timeless system like help like learn learn way notation suppose use tool like end solution like play like kind problem classical music today great want play stravinsky want played exactly way compose left interpretation always really know particular piece music suppose played one way right really know like yeah composer note stuff think musician interpret notation freedom like turntable complete freedom like whatever want rule try create rule try create tool help people learn faster really influence make music come course dj also kind musician oh yeah listen lot jazz lot classical listen everything really get inspire kind artist really see someone painting inspire go write song visualise artist really process artistic process artist relate different artist get inspire everything know kind talent music universal language love see someone street corner play amaze guitar something like inspire think great musician everywhere really learn everybody really close door open door everything say go house dj go hip hop cause grow like like inspire anything let inspire ever close door anything first let say first piece music write first real piece music write use technique antimatter antimatter yeah long work yeah take lot practice cause like well go rough sketch stuff want experiment antimatter want ed write song completely whole entire thing pretty much score entire thing start melody basslines rhythm hi hat snare bass drum separate everything score look score see whole thing go want write first fun part perform cause already knew head like test see would look like notation wise stuff would look like together first real experiment kind met partner raul yanez jazz teacher university back home show help clean little bit well could do many different way interpret notation help clean jazz angle really tighten start talk big idea always write orchestra piece turntable first thought outrageous really understand show score everything get could see basslines could see musical side really basslines like wow rhythm instrument melodic instrument thank god notation cause really open lot door far university able show teacher doctor colleague musical theory practice behind see notation something relate make sense instantly communication matter language speak see language music understand go want adamant turntable notation communication want communication tool really open lot door classical world able orchestra performance show instrument raul partner get start work showcasing world instrument valid artform subculture stay fad scratch around year fad lot people think oh wikki wikki sound hopefully notation thing help break door show world dj artist musical thing vinyl apply musical application dj party wedding whatever want tear door want world tear wall dj lot people think dj artist take talent big thing focus project show world musical place history pretty much passionate antimatter uh huh concerto turntable antimatter think sure would nice listen transition orchestration turntable listen turntable orchestra set think original song orchestra video big project u cause like take u year work project undertaking concerto take couple year write realise classical music always learn like play something piano sound great harmonically everything work melodically start transition instrument thing work g chord sound huge piano sometimes orchestra come way always learn orchestra music much learn insane first get know range instrument first get train instrument able know range finger get know finger really well much kind work project together massive undertaking write orchestra piece turntable experiment also score time like twice amount work first six seven month lot trial error find really range point turntable find like ok go note note rhythmically really mainly find limitation turntable find write concerto piece around limitation turntable first hurdle jump get lot easy construct whole thing realize get image connect hear turntable try basically call concerto turntable basically concerto originally write feature one instrument solo instrument usually violin piano voice lot different instrument basically whole orchestra piece feature one instrument solo instrument time meant introduce new instrument like lot new technique developed composer write concerto feature new stuff create basically feature one thing get idea really excite lot history concerto hundred year old classical structure write orchestra music know theme certain kind rule get follow form basically follow form classical concerto instead violin use turntable first part hear really want blend violin actually use couple violin sound press record manipulate lot pitch pitch control combination fader get rhythm pitch time hear technique try mimic violin first movement two part perform next year october nd carnegie hall new york world premier three part concert yeah yeah premier new york october nd next year carnegie first movement two premier give idea first movement usually introduce main theme second third movement get real crazy like harmonically melodically stuff like like like hip hop music really get verse chorus verse kind theme really extend try really combine world cause come hip hop background want influence also classical form concerto little introduction music dj radar concerto turntable write yeah even solo part middle solo part well concerto call cadenza soloist really freeform variation whatever want well know instrument follow cadenza usual feature soloist virtuoso technique basically follow form cadenza basically solo part piece first movement though two part play note turntable becomes like trombone right really feel note yeah lot practice seriously melodic stuff begin take month practice mean sound really simple coordination get spot indicates pitch control turntable like half tone really hear orchestra hall get precise really take lot practice like de da da da show melody turntable really take practice whole different type approach play turntable get accurate even explain play violin violin one accurate instrument tune tricky violin player incredible ear able play along really take lot practice even stress enough hard play cause violin complex instrument pretty simple compare violin able follow along take lot like mentally spot every note real sign note sign right lot feel really get good feel able correct really quickly practice enough know exactly everything like trombone like slide trombone right exactly create like little gap know note really depends sound cause start sound versus like start b something like choose note start well piece call tonal center orchestra piece tonal center sound use press lot different sound one main sound press would give range g octave able note get really play around note go press press lot different sound lot different note lot trial error able range may get put pitch control way right note may little flat really get plan get know limitation sound use everything long arrange plan get may need go another groove something like extra two three note lot trial error fun able figure turntable fit within orchestra music try different thing different environment arrangement orchestra piece piece write multiple turntable piece quartet do little jazz trio play like drummer band kind like soloist trumpet player go back forth play hammond b player real structure jazz style play lot different time signature kind cool cool thing orchestra music jazz instead everything like hip hop house music always challenge play time signature jazz musician count always countingthinking even play half time might play something really slow think fast order able play something slow yeah able keep jazz musician big challenge whole ball game tackle actually finish album b organ turntable lot different musician little sit night thursday like little jazz night play new arrangement constantly write stuff try different thing jazz stuff love jazz cause much freedom improvise basically like jazz lot freedom able whatever want lot fun able experiment try different idea different rhythm able solo different people real excite difficult hip hop background jazz musician see turntablist think see different texture think relate think relate freedom jazz musician like notation use reference jazz player even master really train musician great ear lot control think appreciate control think quality jazz turntablism turntablism art go trial jazz music jazz long time people think valid music people play believe die stuff turntable kind go struggle people think valid music yet valid instrument jazz kind go struggle look year later almost every school across world jazz school everywhere one point even accepted even medium come word jazz kind medium term think go struggle jazz music jazz musician lot thing relate jazz read berklee school turntable class yes stephen webber good friend mine teach turntable technique eight student pretty excite go basic start right begin scratch like work production work mix board actually emmy composition guitar player really good guitar player yeah teach turntable crazy old guy old professor turntable definitely torn door academia open door bridge gap turntable big university one big jazz school world able turntable think excite great piece played many part write turntable score many stave turntable cause kind hard distinguish thought hearing turntable curious first part want kind hide within violin want sound like violin sense kind want hide within melody yeah main melody hearing turntable turntable two stave top part fader hand second staff non pitch rhythm like percussion like score percussion kind look like bottom stave first stave pitch stuff sound want treble clef would put treble clef score like piano like piano music take type thing like play piano cause hand hand rhythm em one pitch indicates fader hand loop stuff perform two line composition turntable right yeah two stave ok cool show turntable score computer yeah kind hard see write something writes note score first one th note two way say like actually note let pretend non pitch scratch call baby scratch demonstrates baby scratch pretend non pitch pretend yet rhythm e e e e performs notate scratch pretty much thing actually th note add let erase try one say note c something like want opposite notates low half score say long note something long note say sound c go pretend c thing bottom staff see crossfader see hand go ot let note play c pretend c play sound crossfader go play th note go opposite cause remember hand th note fader th note like e e e e demonstrates cross fader movement first bar e e e e thing hand crossfader unlimited combination could triplet crab scratch general term music triplet demonstrates crab scratch triplet basically crab note turn note turn three click whole combination right triplet three note crab triplet start crossfader stuff actually start pitch stuff combination instead learn play whole note demonstrates crab fader whilst move record back forth needle know lot different combination unlimited combination write musical term real basic get really complex depend stuff want write get crazy want however fast want play pretty much anything kind cool like sometimes give pitch part play play note horrible sound record get lose plane even know play problem basically know turntable right whole octave half range sings major scale variation note unlimited thing could sings melody whilst scratch unlimited however want write perform write stuff partner jazz piano player actually play part like real simple actually play right along lot call response stuff like still experiment know endless something go forever ever stop know think great thing world able make musical communicate musician able play stuff play kind cool well first think absolutely amaze really push whole turntablism thing beyond wick wick wick right great question pro tool mix everything thought idea find might part go like oh screw part go back redo interested know would perform stuff live sound really complicate right notation sketch want really like set stone like still stuff protools like freeform write solo part head q bert lot talk scratch like impression scratch mouth whole communication device mouth really bizarre yeah write great solo part come scratch sometimes solo thing notation suppose set stone rough structure forget stuff find multiple take different part yeah oh yeah sometimes rhythm work swing little bit shift little perform little different think notation suppose wide open open interpretation always part score slash mark like jazz music slash mark mean improvise part like instrument get stay key put slash mark let whatever want give orchestra freedom able cause thing want change orchestra music like whole think go school play great piece like mozart piece beethoven bach learn piece play em exactly write want write music interpret freeform whatever know heard ornette coleman say grandfather freeform jazz create freeform term freeform able freeform instrument whole orchestra let whatever want basically think pretty cool think limit everything know like see balance everything notation suppose tool map like ok want want see everything work forget stuff think cool keep freeform stance cause really scratch come think make original instrument right rather always reading music scratch dj evolve much box sheet front right nice balance create interested approach record ultimate goal one scenario maybe full orchestra turntablists come mix real orchestra would ultimate dream stage many different project many different avenue really depends project every project goal think always goal everything whole orchestra thing begin thought impossible young like first start think like way ever able take good ten year ultimate want play orchestra amaze experience musically overwhelm tell first perform orchestra back home powerful experience first people one auditorium one best hall united state orchestra able first person first person play hall cause grow go orchestra like big deal like pretty emotional experience powerful able play musician hear sonically like hear orchestra music real d audience hear stuff sprinkle place hear melody go throughout woodwind violin back viola indicates stereo position hand amaze experience stage come together know amaze something thought dream actually perform never really sank day know amaze experience yeah imagine cause dj many people usually stage normally know even team turntablist thing might four guy maximum orchestra texture low high huge orchestra hall really hear orchestra music cause dynamic really hear everything clean orchestra stage snap finger hear sound go pppppf impersonates sound reverb really weird sound travel hall audio experience like hear cd different d d music definitely experience far production try capture piece studio record orchestra lot trick make sound like orchestra really get think d always like think way pan violin like see stage pan bass little bit horn tuba show hand kind pan stuff little bit fun cause lot stuff surround start move stuff around speaker much work always much piece second movement think put speaker balcony like thing quadraphonic thing show switch mixer send melody around whole orchestra crowd speaker right want stuff like really take top endless every project different far record go really hard capture really gear performance composition work gear live performance think tnem stage kind hard translate studio environment lot surround sound stuff like really capture pretty good sample constantly learn never stop learn try convert live recording think artist balance able capture stuff cd good capture live whole thing like perform live like record guess different every project wonder idea improve typical turntable mixer setup play melody think would great button play definitely like piano something think melody yeah think lot great idea expensive make change believe like stupid thing right hold turntable pitch control probably cost manufacture produce expensive make change turntable yeah love make million change thing work right turntable perform actually make modification like turntable right take second pitch catch go actually tweak electronics little bit spot go right move pitch control right right go right c constantly make modification thing stuff cause tight mean technology already influence dj much remember back day lucky even work crossfader crossfaders static work right button fly break time know old mixer old jazzy jeff mixer huge landmark turntable production actually make mixer design scratch tool well tool well think always go evolve mean idea turntable work hard expensive know ever play percussion drum record yeah sometimes depends kind sound go go like drum turntable try translate drum rhythm turntable mostly yeah work conga player sometimes play part depends question well sorry get couple question take rhythm music approach percussion point view first sort thing one scratch take particular name clyde stubblefield james brown drummer use listen like eight nine year old james brown record would play every song try play one rhythm call shuffle beatboxes hi hat really cool kind jazz thing get influence make scratch like find cut record side well call shuffle something create rhythm clyde stubblefield demonstrates pattern cut kick snare take kinda idea applause like th note triplet yeah actually make hi hat sound crossfader use stuff stuff right play surface noise kick snare make demonstrates pattern always try translate love rhythm much james brown always best drummer take stuff everybody like everybody every composer john williams take stuff everybody one big rip composer make great stuff want take anything away composer evolve take stuff bit piece inspiration long give credit back whole thing like anytime take idea somebody always make sure give credit like whole concerto thing town concerto create get give respect people pave way last year always pay due make sure respect people come even turntable nothing class teach first thing first eight week history scratch technique ok jazzy jeff create jam master jay create obviously q bert create lot stuff think everyone part history big small like include many people possible teach stuff back point take stuff like idea drummer try translate turntable hear melody something try play turntable see see possible know like inspire everything know think learn everyone adapt get idea load different source say play jazz band interested drum pattern jazz would sound like well lot jazz time like demonstrates cut beat play sings bassline hi hat sound like tss tss tss tss section make record start like snare hi hat imitates jazz hi hat pattern throw snare drum imitates drum pattern stuff like try play jazz rhythm try time whole thing always get counting cause guy always know break come know bar right money every time everybody counting everybody counting twelve time whole ball game keep guy cause guy cooking right money mess kind mess big challenge keep professional jazz musician rip humble experience know keep guy learn lot make tighter turntablist spot time guy walk studio one two take whole track whole thing train musician use walk perfect one two take like john coltrane use walk one take wonder would fire record first take people thought warm would fire record use perfect cause train train musician world great back home cause university live great jazz school get play lot musician come night come trade u great experience get play live able stuff trade u solo back forth trumpet whole call response thing take bar take bar take take take take really fun lot fun whatever mean get inspiration everything pretty much whole vibe right inspire able play stage orchestra sound really powerful around music play first movement concerto turntable write raul yanez yeah influence piece like early th entury stravinski yeah kind lot influence like even latin rhythm lot different stuff even raul incredible jazz latin jazz piano player put stuff like lot hidden stuff theme everything could spend day break influence stuff like definitely hear still time mixtapes club sometimes really pretty much gear next couple performance next year club stuff never stop lot fun go make record whole concerto yeah go dvd come two movement next performance carnegie hop able record show give dvd end people come yeah go dvd album already record first movement studio go come whole solo album work orchestral influence piece necessarily concerto stuff inspire fit whole album like turntable quartet piece kind stuff orchestra side thing turntable orchestra kind thing guess crew bomb shelter crew plan something similar fellow crew member hard z trip tour linkin park deal los angeles travel much hard grow together dj z trip emile actually emile start bomb shelter dj back read met sister right yep sure sister use go club lot knew dj stuff like year old back state get place sister somehow get club met emile z trip z trip one big hip hop dj west coast time still mean huge take wing emile techno dj play drum bass like hardcore techno play break electro even back amaze dj like wish cause inspiration emile guy genius music get lot inspiration guy take wing hip hop influence whole electronica influence shape learn lot already scratch met zack show proper technique mark record thing like emile teach electronic music like emile understudy awhile still always learn orchestral thing yeah come premiere definitely go direction someday go reunite make record yeah yeah road combine everything go different direction come back go huge early day turntablism earlystarted talk lot yeah think actually call turntablism think first stage play music turntable first year mostly like guitar player flashy yeah lot flash like body trick stuff flip handstand turntable yeah lot flash think always kind wentvan halen go van halen stage go van halen year turntable flashiness definitely part part history deny think musical approach cause people like style gunkhole melodic stuff think go mastery within melodic line least work think gonna see lot mastery next year hope complete pitch control hand able go e g know pitch hopefully get level know musical era like new renaissance turnablism say something guy willing learn art would say make sure practice every instrument lot practice dedication want see lot people get stuck one type music fine love passionate whatever passionate hopefully around positive people think great everyone seem hardcore music open lot idea think key music key lot success opening every door possible closing door go like ok drum bass sound like drum bass even go listen stupid electronic music call minimalism inaudible world already do do year ago minimalism music like repetitive loop stuff like already create stuff learn everything say create something new chance update music basically update sound something new sound like new sampler new sound really anything new music probably instrument make music change year music really change right exactly think someone start get lot patience take lot practice instrument anything choose even work studio learn mix board mix take like anything trial error lot practice love get stuck one way think follow path let people influence much person make music use turntable use sampler oh yeah use kind stuff full blown studio everything like focus turntable stuff fun love scratch much come natural yeah piano arrangement arrangement non turntable stuff produce hip hop beat ton people back home lot different thing like thing learn everything always like learn love learn much like master one thing one thing turntable question yes microphone want know release battle record far go back home next couple month work record stuff develop year new drum pattern new drum sound stuff work well scratch stuff like go put record totally unique sound melodic stuff lot melodic stuff lot different sound know mean ahhhh fressssssssh kind like know q bert try make standardize sound know like trumpet sound violin sound q bert try standardize try make mean fit within low parameter like go box try little bit everything want come kind new drum pattern instead kick snare kick want come three kick snare different combination really see battle record stuff like go release battle record know know dj focus go collaborate battle record work come later next year anyone question think enough thank much u oh thank
