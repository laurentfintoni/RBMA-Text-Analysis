play much term want fill dancefloor play good music band play go normal club thing end finish multimedia thing call super weird happening label call super weird substance term happeningterm basically artistic event spontaneity thing happen back try kind touch one different find direction set stone perfectly rehearse something allows kind spontaneity like mad kind glorious chaos everyone like really enjoy say barber last night yeah last night one artist barber come mad kind extreme haircut people kind want kind put chair yeah one look around see thing normally see club environment really want take festival think natural state within festival want take area festival curate day program say day would start say festival get bed late night night could come listen interest talk go people say different artistic thing happen like band play eventually full kind club vibe see go hopefully go next year plus one stand alone one event interest place cool like open question mmhmm see anyone anything like know greg career anyone anything shy laugh inaudible think balearic really initially basically ibiza dj play pop music rock music rather black dance music happen uk plenty place obviously go term balearic think recognize ibiza island set everything certain spirit music brought back term derives course think balearic important quite snobby pop music dj know black music real stuff proper dance music kind boop boop obviously great dance record come direction think importance respect maybe tell u one way whatever certainly identify one well mean interestingly think terry farley described balearic dj day think could see mean pick wide spectrum music wide history music come anywhere whereas say past different kind dj generally import somewhere like new york black latino artist know stipulation mean one thing dj legend know always look back always bit sad never played track yazoo françois kevorkian mix situation felt like one step far time mean take much stick play thing like buffalo gal malcolm mclaren black music side like manager sex pistol play punk guy saw move kind away idea play british pop like yazoo do really people like yello swiss band stuff think actually play couple yello track towards end time degree snobbishness think ibiza ecstasy environment open guy witness brought back experienced think important addition remind u music music get kind tie think like credible credible sense listen hear question inaudible well mean straight away really enables brought current context mean say example mighttrackdisco track get like real drummer strict time mix point view easy mix starter god know guysmixed lot must like couple beat next record played know listen back manage get window back time enables contemporize classic track think say exampleknow lot old record people use put straight house beat housing happen almost like appreciate great record sense nothing wrong apart fact need mix need kind make maybe need add bottom end time make sound right environment notice year audience get young year year people come connect type music get like people teenager get hearing mix online hearing edits really get stuff go somebody young say listen get kind day well music lose straightaway get meet respectful come present music way fit e mix contemporary track well warm really great music boil also think conversation year especially ibiza feel ibiza people drive gig people club work stuff real dissatisfaction music think come whole edm thing even though think ibiza part problem go far promoter stuff sudden say even like music play club anymore get stage play thing like though something new although ever since come back emotion within think like vocal musicianship emotional aspect music talk dj berlin put term music technical long technical long come emotional period maybe austerity time living strange time think people need kind uplift sudden track take different context allow people go let go everything go world whereas lot dance music intricate term little niche people side appreciate appreciate technicality beat structure stuff good context time nothing else happen apart think need something human introduce blogged daft punk album come thought real moment point edm thing hit height could take place throne king edm instead reject say music lose direction look bring back musicianship rogers obviously thing like pharell williams think influence young people young musician look music slightly different way maybe people certainly dance music year ago believe move emotional aspect point time
