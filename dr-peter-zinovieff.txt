go rather mind boggling day go different approach within hour great pleasure welcome dr peter zinovieff applause even close right pronunciation would zee nov e eff zin ov e eff come name like heart british empire empire realize one blood russian parent russian born london london right live cambridge wife point wife please welcome well applause listen background part chronometer harrison birtwistle come last year first quad sound classical music piece release dvd ordinary cd sound one side quad could explain layman term quad sound mean quadraphonic piece design birtwistle see later slide studio look like make quadraphonic piece one first quadraphonic piece played stereo milestone original record found last year make dvd record suppose record track ampexes perhaps track studer would set system want play pre dolby scenario lot luck actually computer control sync do computer control fact ray dolby live road studio give u prototype use household name maybe five people room actually might remember dolby sign help tape less noise right yeah every film actual person name yes like bob moog charles hoover invent vacuum cleaner say do computer help remember little dad work military brought little thing home say son computer help u play board game get six lead light dice like look baffle lot easy roll dice use thing well first computer much think something like perhaps even earlier digital equipment pdp first computer private house world computer longer anybody world laughter applause good talk random number easy get computer play dice difficult often happens series number come recognize repetitive luminous watch geiger counter record spontaneous radioactivity derive random number true randomness excuse ignorance would geiger counter house difficult get random number purely get random number almost impossible write mathematical function give non repetitive series probably help wonder found unit year later like hang get six lead manual least double volume point mixer teach well lucky nowadays never manual look pdf file last page find want find day manual wonderful manual helpful far context text search though nowadays people turn page fast ridiculous idea book go next page next page gesture turn page want go page five know page five terrible agree manual labor go flick page terrible laughter still talk time vast majority public know computer end one home marvelous engineer call david cockerell probably go best electronic music engineer ever great gift great gift think something want ring make however difficult make one day say way control multitude oscillator amplifier tape recorder huge array see slide bit say way control computer computer day use factory sort thing turn turn switch first use process control thing obviously go online shop somewhere street would obtain part well company call digital equipment corporation america remember well bought offer course go learn use end course idea absolutely none course people already use computer massive way deck card thing say give case whisky tell could control oscillator say tad auto tad auto language computer meant take number put somewhere go back take next number next stack give realize could take number sequentially give oscillator sound would change worth conversation case whisky tad auto sort whisky share laughter obviously bit left hold glass eureka moment exactly give u perspective one bit information time one notch whatever information parameter change oscillator would repeat exactly operation lot time thousand time second yes make piece like piece press button go whole piece come amaze really time say get thing want originally geologist talk call geology music also middle part also librettist harrison birtwistle write libretto mask orpheus big opera could enlighten u librettist librettist writes scenario word plot play composer writes music big opera point talk exactly thought process perhaps go whether geologist make map whether writer make libretto whether composer computer music electronic music although seem like wild idea hope end see actually use triangle different discipline jump people get actually get involvement certain company might know day part presentation well right em brought along old synthi prototype synthi computer music studio way could finance sell synthesizer studio finance government anything else make synthesizer bread butter thought important work never use really feel shy put pin fortunately set lovely demonstration later anyone play like museum piece extraordinarily enough people want old analog synthesizer imagine really amaze people actual computer world whole fetish machine alien whole philosophy begin away cut tape people make electronic music first slice tape stick together sellotape roughly seem terrible idea developed sequencer reminds bit tape day take pin put somewhere hop sound turn level exactly accurate lot people disagree somewhere time mention work sequencer sequencer foundation u digital audio platform like yes one sound another sound first sequencer make base uniselector old fashion telephone work dial number dial go back draw circle air go pip pip pip pip big number nought maximum number one one pip exchange sequence number come would recognize sequence number connect right telephone exactly use first sequencer first sequencer make use telephone technique like relay would go around make shutter noise would switch different oscillator think first sequencer world hear people work similar concept believe anybody work anything like chance met max mathews bell lab exactly similar work program call groove do synthesizer turn fellow call moog america never heard thought must copy u strange work parallel unknown well guess around probably two people room see correctly quite common thing annoy fuck parent grandparent play telephone relay sound beautiful way similar fascination best thing call phone freak could tap number avoid exchange ultimate phone freak tap enough would go satellite satellite satellite come back noise like shhhhhhhh knew go around world time successful goal laughter say necessity heard moogs world realize enough make living turn business venture think time moog start one point nearly bought nearly go broke afford wish commercial point view come make vcs sat floor studio thought marvelous idea lead even bad cut tape lead connect one place like get still exist extraordinary year hope vcs thing sought never weirdly enough get recognition time never business partner backing american partly take well go go public america company em get cheat american partner give u duff check company collapse sad story really sell machine studio collapse studio take national theatre london time huge hundred hundred lead connect everything see one picture put basement basement leak last time saw equipment cover exercise bicycle water terrible thing ampexes survive end disgraceful story place talk know thing end online found page diary talk rain come studio computer art magazine know get online week busy life studio recall great analogy movie tatar take church monastery right rublev name film tatar come sack whole town rublev great painter icon andrei tarkovsky film yes great cathedral burn say sad rain cathedral like sad rain studio guess get bit context start really go talk people go must explain bit unfortunately slide seem work try skip also new laptop mine seem able liaise properly presentation alright hiccup also anyone want stop point meant light entertainment laughter shall start question moment pause ok start slide say science geological map libretto electronic composition three lucky involvement mine completely different lucky film start go synthesize voice possibly one first big synthesize voice crofter north west scotland tell story crofter steamer isle skye opposite note tidal shore tide go whole area wonderful wonderful volcano million year ago tertiary time look like oxford doctorate area map day band biscuit tin closest come electronic music long time ago another view stayed bothy map mountain climb like day show long ago yeah interested music see synthesizer camp mapped onto aerial photograph analyze rock find little detail various layer like musical composition analyze look tiny detail like crystal look little peculiarity like sample much like sample detail play piece later show work moment scale everything completely important geology deal big little thing contributes whole structure like composition actual chemical structure rock structure ultimate computer music piece say please make composition computer structure act iii see look similar structure crystal ultimate computer composition thing like tension surprise dependency randomness structure third act libretto final geological map end geology bit video play non native speaker whippet studio bottom overlook thames whippet dog excite piece han werner henze wonderful whip piano whip wonderful italian meal terrific adventure italian meal get han brought assistant fausto cooked meal month two wonderful wonderful time sound bad lso stand maybe want pause second london symphony orchestra record clock chronometer science museum world clock go top big ben record different little mechanism actually enlighten u pause moment one thing notice go past church seem terribly tune like good german church bell laugh bell mean yes seem play weird rhythm might rope rather mechanism might difference think think wrong laughter think bell ring proper oh well thought might clock bell video work point wonderful exhibition call cybernetic serendipity point people come along whistle computer computer would analyze whistle would often guess person go whistle next take several popular tune people would whistle computer massive great thing would make tune whistle important advance robot electronic music still talk today real milestone exhibition cybernetic serendipity inaudible dr peter zinovieff yes computer fully transistorize transistor one could actually repair module memory computer half size wall behind suppose k memory end get k hard drive huge never thought could fill laughter k little computer get gb memory half terabyte disc space difference k gb completely amaze computer cost fortune one cost hundred pound benefactor come fortune come bit one first studio built quite lot lead video start oscillator video continue david cockerell video pause actually eat lump sugar meant david cockerell part longer documentary available online yes video start rain talk fall computer piece work stockhausen piece come fiddle around really studio gradually developed something much smarter three child advertisement future opera stage know would involve make opera make crazy advertisement every picnic need synthi everybody need synthi every band video continue like ultimate triple x u invent vocoder first vocoder use lot advertisement lot band use pink floyd good example bought lot every time bought something could experiment video continue studio know still new type computer interested still produce score hope pause say please make beautiful composition bit computer answer say beautiful composition know ask computer back beautiful composition computer course say think answer suppose make answer please make another beautiful composition think succinct computer music score could initial hand behind frivolous idea idea make tetrahedron come back triangle could slice tetrahedron within area tension like expectation surprise greyness dependency tension wherever cut tetrahedron would score would obey emotional rule ambitious idea computer would able image almost like cut stratum rock yes go onto structure act iii base tide saw begin video start oh bit first video continue become famous delia derbyshire start colleague sit stage queen elizabeth hall ridiculous idea video continue cite video neo weber fantastic slideshow continue studio go oxford roughly computer side look like paper tape printer computer set modern experiment music orchestral bach record play follow computer control interpretation played yamaha piano good quest waveform midi wild experiment picture advertising cambridge university alumnus travel program wife wonder scan sibelius sort sound could get instead score think picture could give people use sibelius use scan option picture found bow found point wonderful picture magazine call sourcelavish american magazine bloke huge bit manuscript paper yard away machine gun shoot score bullet hole reduce score people would play sort experiment seem amaze could get someone play piano whatever played would become score front eye involve moment work marvelous violinist play directly sibelius video continue synthesizer old model anyone play afterwards program use moment developed york university part piece sculpture istanbul later year quest waveform midi beethoven convert midi file artificial sing program rough melody could transform beethoven symphony could transform use n track collect thing hearing together midi file beethoven whippet thing come together part henze distort back still whippet heart go boom boom boom beethoven dribble along move along last part libretto part mask orpheus music peter zinovieff selection mask orpheus originally covent garden via glyndebourne end english national opera tide see isle raasay outside house putney london first studio sometimes studio would even flood thames get high always terrible really explain people harrison birtwistle probably distinguish british composer call harrison birtwistle laughter part structure libretto question write word singer sing also contrive artificial thing instance imagine beach various object like bit fishing net old bit bone fossil something tide come cover object tide fall uncovers object time cover uncovered trigger dramatic scene say perhaps death orpheus rebirth orpheus structure tide fall rise structure whole act iii hour long opera way stag type mask people wear gesture make everything dependent thing tide move dedicate sign language something come something come represent main protagonist opera way becomes far away language invent special language speak use word orpheus eurydice syllable invent language context grammar tense vocabulary write use ibm typewriter word processor day overlap letter singer sing look something incomprehensible well language incomprehensible sort way know see translation english orphic complicate although simple orpheus might sing something like see oar shore would say make incomprehensible sound never sung untranslatable except notion song invent language music philip langridge selection mask orpheus philip langridge die two day ago although english opera one understand word difficult invent new thing sing professional singer learn heart use professional singer professional component synthesize language basically sing opera proper full scale opera involve sculpture way istanbul seville bartók laterecorded lot folk song turkey one fiddle slide last slide music start get archive use sort song bartók record wire recorder basically similar ralph peer guy america go document folk song sort thing hear heartbeat emphasize begin beethoven course computer use equipment york university control sculpture wherever york sculpture loudspeaker must elaborate sound installation world control york university one composer produce music istanbul york university make amaze little program one allows slow music without change pitch lose information another one extraordinary filter bank something like filter graphic display take tiny little part sound want incredibly luxurious max msp program make max msp music programmer delight think complicate wonderful recommend anyone expensive though origin russian troika end little demonstration answer question slide go back thank applause guess open question fly around ok saucy one first hear right delia derbyshire assistant stage yes lucky form group call unit delta plus get delia derbyshire brian hodgson bbc help radiophonic workshop already left radiophonic workshop join idea would make fortune commercial sound interested commercial sound one philip something like whoooop get lot money want split succeed either want commercial studio want experimental studio good composer could work pay fact rather like organization sort philosophy anyone good project could come work studio charge henze birtwistle come quite often art council course perhaps people would come study month way similar red bull music academy think obviously judge retrospect amaze watch documentary radiophonic workshop amaze archive film idea exist year ago extraordinary look think actually happen recall people public environment publicly fund well perceive like well general public radiophonic workshop really purely sound effect radio become famous doctor otherwise primitive tape studio way research studio bought instance em equipment equipment never advanced way cologne utrecht columbia academic research studio customer time mention educational broadcasting facility kind mixed role cologne facility professor podmore would able tell still like bizarre museum one able get massive chunk money sunk place else could afford thing mainly radio station university everybody bought little one like big synthi big version perhaps someone would come hold interviewer hold synthesizer way around want gentle synthi primitive one first one make huge version call synthi think make know many still around obviously know picture want find one anyone know one pay money know sell fortune saw one internet go six digit figure go tell think people talk orphic know make german company ludwig rehberg german agent fact robin wood studio assistant own em start remake batch vcsexactly original go cost fortune whole idea original cheap musician could buy one sort yes think say like ad vcs yes time obviously totally different half price car half price car small car really compare many electronic thing say want every musician able buy end band like pink floyd well sell several thousand several thousand buy sort price moogs america bear mind pocket calculator cost lot money telephone cost fortune mobile telephone expensive fact thing much cheaper mean people bought still feel even lateactual financial fund obtain physical unit big threshold many people music whereas matter find free wifi computer well program computer still quite expensive lot easy find another version steal physical unit let say powerful enough computer run good computer synthesis program midi input thing want quite lot money spend need lot data storage need lot peripheral would cost two thousand two half thousand pound think people would standard unit grand input amplifier amplification different thing people use headphone look around really answer use lot record suite people able come go high class equipment much well limited facility good equipment lot bad equipment go around also headphone really hear go sound like high quality program use well facility still nothing like end begin computer program terribly primitive mix program stuff midi incredibly naive sample still naive still begin electronic music happen something sometimes feel overlook talk history synthesis mostly talk warm sound get original sound sort stuff strike get touch unit first time actually inherent rhythm within lot sound provide rhythmic element straight away apply sort modulation oscillator opposite rhythm silence maybe interest thing people would go want get sound single hit note one shot note synthesize sound lot movement within beauty use analog equipment manipulate parameter rhythm lot directly computer screen think true jono podmore think true agree thing find ak vcs parameter touch immediately use mouse trackpad use one parameter time get much access part machine play number simultaneously much difficult current state digital equipment think right think david cockerell see lot picture want make implant arm day long time ago would purely control voltage control oscillator thought able think high note would come high note reason absolutely none could train arm find doctor laughter true design thing jono podmore maybe could put whippet maybe think say right would much well multi sensory input case need physical thing get two hand five finger would much well joking direct thought computer control sure pretty aware lot experiment last year found current use brain low amplitude big enough pick ups recognize difference far least yes direct brain rhythm talk talk muscular consciously control part body thought control learn learn control muscle slightest change voltage high low frequency several move different finger would advantage big brain information go make finger turn something able turn laughter scientist house work one think anyway forecast year ago talk way year ago talk another year say whatever acceleration basically suggest go neuro scientist get intel anybody experiment ray kurzweil sure familiar work talk thing scan brain wifi connect synthesizer via chip head seem like idea lot people talk question want head want somewhere else nose perhaps think computer music begin make huge advance first music program first computer synthesis program advance time think go rather static phase moment produce program produce polished nugget sound without enough scope wild experiment feel might right invent completely new program use midi say york university one trevor wishart still york university work sculpture show finance morning line finance whole new research department several million pound york university tony myatt annex get fantastic facility good record studio state art britain excuse go gush minute found mapping libretto extremely freaky kid try figure produce notice favorite track record number seven figure need reason listen record cartesian plane time value would always rock record much rock soul record soulful come exact curve best album time later year film school learn classical story structure exact curve freaky shit number seven aleister crowley book seven magic number magic number surprise laughter anyway question first many question see much time experiment try impose curve upon music write cooking whatever come perfect album something say non quantifiable thing perfect album adhere perfect curve cater unquantifiable thing make beautiful inspiration think come back geiger counter luminous watch random number important tame randomness although randomness tame direction want unexpected inspiration tame unexpected unexpected come randomness compose write introduce randomness suppose allow poet would surely say random element come paper every word preordain must good idea good idea come maybe sunshine case rise tide tide move incredibly good inspiration pattern fluke randomness let open thing let come jono podmore one point talk early one reason synthesizer like synthi become popular day analog nature degree randomness behave put right number right box digital piece software run computer exactly slightly random nature little bit grit carbon track little bit inspiration come people grown completely work digital domain yes right new life electronic music lucky new life year ago find use real sound randomness come bit played sample different sample varies randomness trouble feel synthesizer know sound repetitive whereas gigantic sound orchestra two piece music live performer ever take piece sheet music two performance ever history identical translation score idea completely amaze think talk essence music always something unexpected say randomness vibrato violin ever previous one another thing freaky also do similar experiment little gm audio midi converter box meant play monophonic guitar line would put random found sound see synthesizer would play rubbish company call melodyne allows able sample chord break part already melodyne produce new version melodyne melodyne already allows shift move chord stretch apart amaze program amaze example show beethoven transform recognizable remember tubular bell chose still recognizable beethoven although waveform midi completely extraordinary think question sorry go jump quickly seem talk sound synthesizer kind randomness sound really seek old gear like character touch midi thing convert actual audio midi foresee time digitize sound instrument think lot old experiment hear mellotron choir stuff closest ever get please sound convert electronic thing midi signal seem far away actual feel real instrument lot lovely piano life get yamaha clp get steinway sample piano play back lovely lovely piano control midi come synthetic sample real piano lovely sound hard push say piano new sibelius orchestra sound good new version instrumental sound especially sample one get real sound improve actual amount gigabyte need sample large space becomes faster memory even well matter big sample able synthesize realistic sound anyone agree kind go computer always go x amount number matter high set parameter beauty early synthesizer love even though create electronic sound always beauty randomness something put finger ever go point time computer think head way computer listen sound head hear differently time probably answer yes give u example use image transform score sibelius talk randomness importance randomness music balance randomness order suggest use device give example score ok score base image make piece work point well hope go tell laugh want answer question million way would wonderful could say want secret give piece paper would love piece paper another question bit technical mention geiger counter algorithm use back still less still ring base exactly would insert random number geiger counter sampler would sample number click give geiger counter derive number list number ever generate list number contain number whatever way like sequence repeat sequence would never repeat would always come forever constantly use different right come time would usb geiger counter come random number easy mathematics choose number use modulo remainder big device would easy think anyone make one would nice little usb plug like think use online casino generate sequence oh get sequence sure would nice self contain sequence somebody else get online someone else use sequence longer random never totally random purpose u ah yes true ok question one well somehow match geiger counter personal dna somehow totally independent laugh read morning line month come collaboration installation various artist spain yes five composer seville open another five istanbul different version istanbul yes fantastic extravagance sculpture cost refurbish cost refurbish cost move must move seville northampton britain recover rewire refurbish cost send istanbul istanbul last month cost send wherever another lot composer one extravagant wild artistic gesture ever do read bit heard lot randomness especially fractal nature actual sculpture one artist really interest roc jiménez de cisneros spain barcelona really interest electronic music record gas horn york university maybe heard weird electronic composition deal lot randomness replicate randomness totally non synthesize way gas horn physical instrument like would synthesizer physical realm believe tendency post electronic music actually electronic use organic mean make different sound probably heard nature really believe tendency yes immediately record like sample electronic yeah record replicate live performance yeah mp float around right lion bird unless recode would difficult originally sculpture go come year queen elizabeth hall london shape south bank decide would difficult put wheelchair access refuse go istanbul get another question digital workstation use day western sense left right write western world think backlash towards hope terrible look alike similar one person say like apple versus pc use one use would marvelous revolution different concept score go left right like yes believe lot young artist include put idea program learn use program instead let idea flow agree spherical interface would ideal something tactile come back interface computer thing linear door frustrate really yes even work structure really hard use ableton anyway yeah go different dimension straight away yeah vertically really know structure stuff maybe come different background non pop music perhaps different scale could see whole thing different three dimensional way use think need revolution write program seriously really good cod try learn program baffle abstract need david cockerell field concept need someone screw put online lecture get request put email address stream exactly happen interview australian film call future sound like end say wish could find someone work immediately morning line thing come york university thing come film broadcast find people come help email address put please contact moises_h hotmail com deal pay give beer maybe laughter chance read book call zen art motorcycle maintenance long time ago look day concept classic thought versus romantic thought classic much underlie form thing really work get nitty gritty break part get romantic side sound good cool essentially know cover chaos versus order thing randomness obviously brilliant mind able invent language get synthesis pretty amaze translate music make knowledge something sense beauty know idea laughter ok probably one best lesson know say know jono podmore interest point friend touch earlier say come popular music background approach sequencer whatever different one reason appreciate crowd work massive influence popular culture rather high art academic university culture work see would influence popular culture commercial culture really fluke age get opportunity try new technique knowledge use like therefore way advantage able jump care gather people like together well get email address laugh must give participant give email address write people like think best revolutionize state play moment people like david cockerell say yes concept jono podmore feel something remains academic culture much great repercussion popular culture think must popular culture say many people able synthesize music way like say lot people good piano mean lot good pianist piano clever get wonderful format use finger sort thing wonderful format think yet wonderful format make inventive electronic music say wonderful device control thought question improvisation electronic musician guess answer program perform show score begin grand idea surprise tension greyness dependency happen notion inspiration music school do yet think complete control go back moises say different way approach electronic music would able express like concert pianist obviously electronic realm perhaps could great grandchild think next level improvisational electronic music must depends good input device subtler mouse keyboard terrible terrible laugh inaudible well monosyllabic way already multi touch controller magazine mention source look music library wonderful extravagant magazine thick record one page different material animal fur touch touch different thing think music music score brilliant close eye touch different thing score page laid thing touch mean use different tactile thing make friend want good input programmer maybe use motion capture put marker arm infra red camera take movement make translate movement midi message could go image sound yeah would language alright get hundred mouse good dancer get infra red camera get mass information mean get mass movement information make good music translation one thought instead use implant motion capture could like sound wonderful love hear piece see would visual well another one guess break interested give little demo unit rest relieve lunch break release laugh see total division people absolutely others like planet right sorry keep bring back corner term thing touch different controller give control variety different sound still think different controller implant motion capture whatever would make complete control sound still confine bound control say western harmony return question get idea would could possibly know unknown technique future hand boy say scotland laughter well maybe heard first good luck guess probably perfect end future hand join thank dr peter zinovieff applause
