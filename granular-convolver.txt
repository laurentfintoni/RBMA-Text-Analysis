today gonna present granular convolver already state device make especially participant red bull music academy take place berlin actually second time max collaborate first last year show la call car composition audiovisual artist ryoji ikeda make sine wave generator different frequency played back car stupidly big soundsystems make big drone piece speaker hold sine wave generator conveniently timer keep track lecture know wannatalk actually know guy met work know max since know eight year roughly eight year nine year maybe met university undergrad electrical engineering start study back together kept work several project research together well go together degree go stanford ccrma research together collaborate different project synthesis dsp particular one particular yeah one particular public yet yeah work something oh ok sorry also make sound brought chris cause work together time last year team make convolver also left mari matsutoya multidisciplinary artist work field technology embodiment gender actually do collaboration laurel halo use hatsune miku vocaloid another thing take apart electronic device stage put back together granular convolver rendition performance take place background give lecture screen next speaker show top view performance throughout like explain thing actually call granular convolver combination granular synthesis mathematical process call convolution come well firstly want excuse build something think build would especially make academy participant dub siren yeah could dub siren thank god make dub siren kind synthesizer would certain sound want make something would impose certain sound certain tone everybody work challenge make instrument voice instead would give voice obvious thing work sample obviously million sampler hardware software next idea use sample granular synthesis would kind sound like granular synthesis kind stuck max mention complete different project use convolution convolution broad term way combine two sound together people usually associate convolution reverb processing actually way combine two sound together match spectrum pick bit common sound way marry two sound together come new sound sound like two original sound actually different well think maybe sample granular synthesis really zoom sample pick bit sound interest convolve another sound come real time could anything could work people synth geek could work people instrumentalist vocalist drummer would something everyone would able use look like speaker hold granular convolver record slot choose slot best illustrate actually record sample speaker connects granular convolver microphone gonna record cymbal speaker hit cymbal play back ok granular bit slice small fragment sample two control grain size size fragment position sample pick fragment preview grain granular convolver make short stutter sound change position within sample pick specific part sample attack portion would bit move decay hear high frequency die away speaker scrub granular convolver record sound like still listen grain right idea convolve something else example connect contact mic start convolve speaker attache contact mic granular convolver begin tap finger right convolve pickup pick hit excites sample tap nail get high tap finger get much maybe tap gently mic quiet get different expression different version cymbal sound accord input put inside show sound demo later conjunction bit detailed explanation convolution actually sent academy participant know academy go around see studio happens building participant come different country idea send come berlin collect sound home different kind level communication language collaborate work new sound together sent pickup courtesy korg mics courtesy audio technica come finish first sound pretty crazy stuff really important handheld device think first time take form hardware device battery power go around pick sound although usb circuit power load sample unit whole point physical presence sound capture also regard control see screen mari take apart control custom make project make berlin actually amazingly one know see screen laser engrave back name participant time instrument kind like letter participant say hey check also form take big knob way think make instrument actually need unfold experience say stuff need speak big thing big want resolution want detail navigate sample grain size slider maybe wannafast cut longer grain ambient sound shorter grain sound like filter thing take account design thing also really want strip bare minimum idea add filter output kind compression output make easy use time think hell know participant come use way like yeah let keep open let keep simple two control open people add sure people come term sound right people would use technique clue yeah exactly mean thing might think right complete wrong direction people might wannacut grain convolve also actual industrial design reflect get surface treatment make sheet stainless steel laser cut speaker hold cut piece sheet metal fold box surface finish way buy material get matte gray metal feel knob machine machining mark kind pure kind raw feel important convey message speak user talk inside max talk nut bolt gut yeah think far enough see inside gut convolver imagine convolver shrink full computer midi controller front computer take speaker reference happen screen green little chip middle cable board speaker move screen board actually full computer computer ghz raspberry pi run audio algorithm board design contains soundcard differential mic input board board take control manages knob button led power management say computer midi controller midi controller actually point controller screen microprocessor take care power management battery usb led shutdown power sequence button sends midi board computer raspberry pi raspberry pi actually run linux custom linux make guy boot quickly cause wannawait second second convolver start computer connect soundcard whole audio stuff happens audio go computer process go imagine like daw computer input output place software call supercollider open source software operating script imagine like plugin input output process sound run algorithm control interface board bottom basically might call midi controller right actually sends midi cable board exactly yeah base around open source software basically talk someone old engineer recently say year year ago hard get access specialized chip dsp power computer power stuff able project fast time access building block set together couple building block arm processor low level stuff power stuff document community around forum tutorial application note raspberry pi special version raspberry pi raspberry pi like tiny compute platform powerful processor slimline version compute module go little socket stuff documentation freely available real benefit architecture could set one great advantage u full linux run software know normal full size linux obviously allows super rapid prototyping allow try thing quickly work right right supercollider cross platform supercollider would also run mac supercollider script language script want process sound ran chris mac ran linux machine ran well tiny little computer workflow pretty well define begin program develop embed stuff midi controller chris would supercollider mac raspberry pi part ready yet could start develop agree specification communicate layer midi could use mac write script get dsp ready stuff ready join everything think great time building stuff right worry less building small detail make work worry creative implication think access kind technology first make easy use definitely also mean time worry do creative side use technology think really good example actually project yeah definitely use mean resource people guess thing like max live ableton either build instrument use people instrument think really interest time musician visual artist access technology really cool stuff without skill knowledge detail work macro state think really great even design custom hardware board kit audio everything work engineer device think another nice benefit thing convolver state completely open hackable would encourage everyone one screw open read instruction back connect change convolver whatever convolver dub siren dub siren yeah check actual access code snoop around bit yeah shall talk convolution actually yeah convolution convolution great time well talk need explain sound right well guess least specific representation luckily something prepared since already use screen tatsuya hold large graph right ok remember record hit cymbal picked little grain less could imagine grain played back little hit heard represent kind way assume familiar spectrum listen cymbal yeah listen play back yeah yeah let listen cymbal sound record cymbal sound play listen closely high bit yeah right essentially break sound call spectrum right low frequency mid frequency high frequency low frequency would bass mid frequency would voice guitar high frequency hi hat essentially sound split high go louder specific area sound cymbal record example obviously lot energy high percussive sound also interest pattern point low frequency part graph could think representation sound actually sound ear right quite bit high little bit low think convolution actually get toy speaker pick another graph white noise play sound frequency time loudness get something like max make white noise sound granular convolver call white noise right sound low mids high frequency kind level cool thing convolve two thing actually get sound overlap two dark shade area tell less exactly original sound right cymbal sound convolve white noise since convolution essentially multiplication two thing represent dark area almost original sound right maybe hear real quick convolution hear noise noise without convolution right ok play back old sound already kind boring let maybe go basic sound imagine single frequency essentially oscillator sound like speaker pick another graph little right single sinusoid play low bass note right mid go high thing true convolution multiplication two spectrum see something cool move around different part two spectrum overlap different part shade dark right hear result convolution max go frequency spectrum use granular convolver right tell less describe sort mix signal obviously go bit also kind boring input signal use interest complex spectrum case represent complex synth note right maybe sound like synth play define fundamental like overtone something would come synthesizer something really cool happens really complex overlap two spectrum obviously move around right obviously depend obviously depend signal overlap change produce really interest new sonic property right obviously need use synthesize sound use example voice straightforward mine help thank stand couple minute tatsuya speaks mic connect granular convolver think since control maybe talk bit go speaker talk inaudibly granular convolver speak ride cymbal get different tone quality right want play bit right obviously go ahead jam afterwards yeah ok finish rebuild thing point screen mari finish mean jam bit convolver beast stay cymbal mean also check else tat record secretly might embarrass idea sample mean limited impulse stuff like cymbal record basically convolution personally find work best think like one thing impulse one thing textural reminds maybe bit familiar convolution reverb record room impulse response catch whole frequency information resonant information room cymbal impulse transfer textural impulse sound texture cymbal want say work best use one one textural thing one impulse thing think yeah think course yeah see people term one convolve flute spoken voice synths synths combination rhythmical thing textural thing think textural thing yeah true also go long speaker make drone sound granular convolver still hear cymbal attack stuff hissy stuff cymbal cut sound change drastically different sound good one think flexitone anyone know max hear dry sound also sample recognize sample ok dry sound dry sound yeah still recognize oh remember sample use gig actually load drink trolley drag across floor thought wonderful sound yep mean played gig already moscow think right yeah experience really good go around look interest sound guess point instrument yes fun interest way work sound new way work sound ultimately listen pay attention sound think real driver drive creativity inspire people make different music think far pretty positive term one go well everyone engage see least three act incorporate convolver live set see happens term two maybe footage due come think wrap talk yeah ok go speaker point screen bravo mari yeah think open question open conversation guy mic somewhere question easy cool leave oh super cool idea fuse two different sound make sound new thing say combine two different synthesizer example imagine turn really funky stuff question do do put technology small device second think latter do convolution like hundred year old something like super old yeah expensive computationally expensive process recently last decade possible actually use processing sound even recent actually put handheld hardware device think knowledge first time kind convolution granular convolution put dedicate piece hardware mean sorry think place creative music production context would least user come contact convolution reverbs reverb plugins guitar simulation probably amp simulation right think actually know convolution inside sure yeah time read convolution maybe reverb context use plugins already since usually plenty power machine think outside maybe sound design much focus creative process tat may call tat course cool say use one gig yes kind sound use spoke difference impulse textural stuff like hear use set played ambient set combination percussive sound synthesizer simple set two synthesizer actually korg volca fm go korg monotribe analog synth analog drum monotribe filter fm output essentially like one output go convolver mix percussive hat kind pad chord stuff chopped monotribe filter one favorite combination way smear use device convolve trolley sound heard make really beautiful texture change grain size slowly go sample pick various small nuance grain move whole hour thought great yeah curious hear hope others thanks thank two part question say basically convolution multiply right multiply two wave spectrum frequency domain sound mean oh ok show screen show yeah yeah question eurorack module multiplier essentially convolution multiply time domain wave imagine sine wave max draw sine wave air hand oh see would represent line spectrum spectrogram show frequency magnitude sine wave time domain look like go forever spectrum one line want multiply frequency sound time domain signal waveform transfer would ring modulator right exactly third part guess something multiplication connect granular synthesizer essentially get convolver right right still multiply time domain signal ok say something multiplication spectrum multiplication convolution mean convolution yeah convolution device kind granular thing mean even need granular sampler maybe granular convolver take call grain big record analyzes frequency content grain us fingerprint imply live input change control slice different grain calculation parallel analyze one crossfade different grain something convolution always need something analyze would actually plan eurorack format even plan sell thing ok ok yeah know like say raw minimal implementation granular convolution think still learn still try figure firstly whether would make good commercial product possibility think open thing kind try absorb right mean see already form factor round discussion also hold want nice thing collaboration tat academy think also besides lot fun also make material study product design study super far commercial product every sense manufacturing make sense make like nice like feel good see people use stuff look lot bad yeah thing guy speaker pick granular convolver prototype actually explore aluminum one explore stainless steel one answer question another perspective would also completely engineer every sense would idea make available thanks nice say nice well thanks great talk visual aid amaze may borrow teach future question actually quite simple choice technology unit use raspberry pi maybe support first question guess convolution experience simple concept hard implement right cpu hungry unique product opinion well really product unique device question much push limit raspberry pi mention hack much space leave anyone lucky enough one much still top already run well use two four core actually trade battery life portable device find balance would make sense want really push capability raspberry pi yes would get really point would probably get longer grain size would able work longer grain cause currently set seven millisecond enough wannazoom certain fragment sound use actually need long convolution kind depends want term performance yeah push bit maybe bit detail general cpu load wise average yeah thinkmaybe mean whatever precise number since certain time lot case time wise performance spike obviously hit otherwise drop out sound absolutely terrible screen drop miss frame bad sound tiny slice silence sound terrible absolutely cannot drop single frame obviously might problem actually average cpu load high ask term curiosity much hack space yeah space great remove convolver script put something else laugh full cpu power right thanks guy good ok let wrap thank much attention yeah thanks thank applause
