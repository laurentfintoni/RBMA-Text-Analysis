listen use ear basically get idea rare match good record really rare really good put quite high price demand would increase literally supply demand simple demand much high good record supply low mean price high vice versa well one really want rubbish record one really want common one buy anyway price quite low literally classic supply demand situation lot people producer especially buy record break stuff really reason get music right actual content record purely music like anyone else want get record love music heard one want hear another one hear another one want find want get record hear music much one lot people people end sell much eventually could make living people necessarily culture generation seem like bit elitist culture thing sell record quid dollar whatever always try hide label find thing next man get extent elitist culture something anyone get elitist yeah sometimes good thing sometimes bad thing good way certain pedigree high value put rare record mean people go value therefore go go look go make new discovery get incentive go try find new thing rare thing expensive thing get money basically mean new discovery go make hand bad people buy record expensive record wrong reason massage ego feel good show friend necessarily good thing best thing fact could rare expensive people take effort go find thing otherwise half record reissue lot people really enjoy

bit well turn brought back one ever heard london djed munich remember really good response even though bit quirky one hear thought person get record lot people really like make sense reissue way everyone else like able hear instead bedroom put single put single one format originally come secondly thought one want buy go lose much money seven pretty cheap make compare cd album whatever music kathleen emery sometimes feel like motherless child kathleen emery sometimes feel like motherless child right also decide cd well cd start do ten single make sense put cd everyone get record player simple also make business sense sell record stay business although cd person much vinyl person make sense spread music use whatever medium take one thing strike way stuff completely respect artist mean amaze sleeve note stuff remember say take three year put together one comp funk one take yeah last one take three year one well reason behind lot research original look internet get information put artist meet artist individually interview get information take long time find go america meet interview see really important type music put otherwise forgotten lot obscure rare people otherwise would never know take lot time effort one find first place two actually go reissue stuff properly otherwise would never get know get forgotten completely people would know would collector dj see music proper historical significance history music state state whole world especially funk stuff basis lot modern music james brown stevie wonder aretha franklin lot local artist never get big see important get limelight deserve never get first place one main reason go record store get cd rockabilly doo wop reggae get thousand liner note document read funk stuff little document year ago bought funk cd earth wind fire stevie wonder something well hell lot try show put cd business side important well lot comp put rare stuff funk soul perspective want share people know sometimes everyone business straight sometimes hard track original artist especially case people cut one couple single whatever quite important make sure good hard take u five year find one guy call arthur monday instance make couple record release small californian label tracked nursing home louisiana lot track get give credit malcolm catto work mean stay early hour morning ring people name phone book find even though spoke people none happen person really painstaking work worth end actually come across guy go meet interview really good meet someone appreciates fact spent time effort find make record say year ago never ever thought would see light day tell go get paid sometimes think pay get put cd say pay put cd get royalty actually get recognition first time time even time release may never get proper release might get ripped whatever satisfy fulfil meet old guy even take lot work effort go meet like say see important part document musical history state one else think stone throw state another company forget name take effort many people suppose could say gap market well one bother like soul jazz well certain extent get particular good story particular case study people tracked well arthur monday one pretty good five year look nursing home suddenly appear wheelchair good see grin face good meeting james dole highlighter song call funky corner start dance living room good meeting people like billy larkin whose hammond organ porch cover dust cobweb cover tarpaulin ripped start play u even though plug think one spring mind let know sec basically great meeting old guy mostly little success someone come woodwork travel england really pretty chuffed someone take interest especially music make actually properly good stuff lot funk stuff mean lot funk music make day lot pretty bad lot deserves never heard really good look really properly good one think shame lot never get success could deserve back first release lot guy know good one reason another story put cd never actually get due deserve get example one type record could play could play one fred williams people might recognize talib kweli sample recently track number seven music fred williams tell anyone recognize talib kweli use recently remember song inaudible suggestion camera one album call midwest funktornado alley mean cd much care love go one almost mini essay one must take year thing yeah one take u two three year well american issue stone throw release state yeah take age like say meet artist producer right get interview get story information otherwise nothing internet nothing try properly otherwise story never get told picture record record people pay lot money album real money people spend alwaysreal super expensive buying market tend way actually yeah probably look single one song three minute long lot thing independently make quite rare probably make hundred time band probably make one single single rare expensive probably encapsulates sole artistic output band condense one single single album anything else one thing concentration musical legacy one little three minute song concentrate one little thing think lot value art go whole album load load album spread across lot output mean think value artisticness spread dilute think people value single lot concentration output one specific little thing three minute long concentrate thing expensive song heard well northern soul record tend sell money thing garage record well garage record northern soul record bat eyelid spending thousand thousand pound like one song example tell northern garage know collector story look high price ebay funk thing sell many uncommon see four figure seven inch single funk music kind thing dealingwith fornorthern lot less recordsandmore people demand lot high supply low assimple supply demand might want answer ever paid record pay lot money record really want make excuse say want reissue something allow anyone ever paid one record paid couple thousand pound single couple occasion know guy want pay pretty much worth one two know copy world price year year buying record still buzz hear record get nothing go stand way yeah mind copy fred williams played copy sometimes record get skin inside get head get ta cd get ta original artifact take month year find miss opportunity may never see get ta bite bullet one thing spending money record people balk pay sort price see anyone anyone find cheap record sell ebay put enough money paypal account enough time eventually get enough money paypal account buy record want matter want work find record bother buying sell stuff get money need certain amount dedication certain manpower real trick like say earlier spend lot money record trick find cheap nothing clever spending thousand pound record find record fifty cent dollar cleverness way say must emphasize uh well find record like dollar really rare one meet office get rare record one example instance james bell guy talk copy funky corner worth thousand pound whatever say want sell say oh yeah ten buck um take ten dollar sooner later find worth lot money start hat u take advantage anything like people would idea pay artist proper price record get take advantage say people say might well collect stamp marble something mean people obsessive culture seem like hoard well stamp collector get reason collect stamp everyone get reason stuff music believe musician create record first place music first place able express get people listen enjoy dance record collector buy keep dj cover tell anyone think disrespectful essence music make first place cover record another reason reissue spread music otherwise would get opportunity spread first place one reason know reissue anything everyone get reason thing believe spread one main reason philosophy behind label must say percent stuff hear reissue never ever heard play couple thing give idea long since many put think start seven eight per year something try one every month easy song call new generation universal another funk one music universal new generation lot beatmakers sit room hear record particular way certain bit record spring know lot producer year always traditionally come see london hte people bought break really buy break anymore usedsort change lot last year hip hop producer lot buy drum past rather pm gong one guy want every single record get drum break even really rubbish record otherwise pay whatever take pete rock bought record um king see lot people quite know guy public enemy forgot name whose record collection burn bit grim anyway like guy say lot people sample record anymore make beat contemporary music really much time get stuck past basically generally much like say really stuck old day much traditional sense like band like feel big combination group people play together musical instrument busy research time get new stuff think current favorite band broadcast birmingham england interest lot people type music play come b boy angle well break angle big thing record entirety yeah understand people like thing reason like everyone come music different angle everyone get agenda personally depends whether feel inside whether get skin criterion good record whether new old whether get inside get head concerned strictly play old music play mostly bother lug lpsaround play old music new thing come single mostly like fit box basically get book people want hear want hear old music get book otherwise development technology mp people buying stuff online affected business um think may do know record get get copyright downloadable element think downloadable music look modern thing recent concept think people like old music manner talk people like hear old format seven inch single lp even cd call old ok still manufacturing lot people buy simply different know change norm like people may seem novelty thing still make enough sell enough make worthwhile must something right people must still like otherwise one would buy mean obviously dj played big part keep vinyl culture alive healthy even dj start move realm serato computer dj always community people look buy rare record ever die become likethink die eventually sooner later many record know must billion thing disappear overnight literally many even people move onto computer onto modern form music storage always go people like music regardless format mean listen single deny fact decrease mean say go go forever many around happen hear lot people hundred thousand record legendary collection know lot serious collector chaff many record home um single get thousand album probably three thousand something like enough get probably get rid hear people odd thousand head keep know everything think get right sort size manage people mail order internet right cd yeah get distribution well get sell world website sell month get shop marketing issue get work pretty well get full value get month shop sell everyone else sort thing yeah since latewell work pretty good dj regularly mostly gig europe yeah mostly club spain germany france italy wherever much england talk u couple project like florida funk different theme yeah happen year ago dj shadow around play lot single found texas suddenly dawn maybe collection album call texas funk make funkstate texas great leap knowledge realize could state america well midwest one next one agenda florida one release yet one hold cd cover one save quite long time take several year get copyright interview find artist everything florida one late one pretty chuffed able put one take age get together one do one one compilation quantic endorse u world rarest funkgot lotreally rare one know copy world handful something like put best onto cd like say earlier lot rare funkwhatevermatter rubbish one know copy good point value put onto cd one take best one rarest time put cd find artist get photograph interview story told one aspect stuff funk thing basically try represent lot one else jazzman label try put variety music label funk singer put jazzy one fusion one disco type onesmod one weird thing pretty much uncategorizable put massive variety thing label label get cd do compile various side b side single get one soul freedom fact read blurb madcap live record breathtaking female song space cosmic jazz heavy deep funk rarest rare groove get wide variety stuff common denominator single pretty obscure hard find good worthy take obscurity release first time proper context sense example egyptian music record one next thing put whole album stuff come recently classic example talk hell egyptian jazz music even thought thing exist especially stuff pretty listenable danceable even let play music salah ragab cairo jazz band egypt strut egyptian jazz salah ragab egypt like say obscure record like never get reissue never go get heard think musically valid lot people listen music american stuff european stuff stuff world good music world take bit time dig stuff stuff oddball stuff like straight ahead stuff thing hercules aaron neville definitely worth put music aaron neville hercules stick something else another one example soul music new york latin ricardo marrero music ricardo marrero babalonia latin funk new york one thing guy ricardo marrero master tape steal one employee studio whole thing release without know funny little story like find really interest sort thing write booklet otherwise hear record hear record know anything producer musician think pretty valid hear story musician say music make well rather purely music make know anything pretty important u write stuff cd find music master still master seven bit lot time take vinyl tape originally record deteriorate get lose year record press tape superfluous lot time get rid lose whatever reason bit shame anyway want play letta mbulu track vinyl cd right yeah know work thing bootleg quite lotput legitimately towards end right yeah flip lorez alexandria try make theme single put particular one get two female vocal side ricardo marrero one different version song side get two song side rather b side single put filler track pretty popular one letta mbulu sell quite copy music letta mbulu wrong groovin question time question straight away get mic hello hello actually also disease disco record original disco record use collect little bit funk also kapp dodge one real men special area funk collector disco lover rumor big collection start sell record get fed say something like time get living record tire think would great sell every record go miami every week sell already sell lot record already know think need money certain personal problem put lot record new type dubplate etch plastic rub lacquer lot record already gotten rid use money put money put record onto plastic vinyl dubplate thing dj mostly really buy spend money like use notorious reputation raise price lot record proclaim everyone pay money anyone else rare record one reason get big collection rarity probably responsible huge price rise funk record ninety kapp dodge fault admit fault amongst community record dealer record collector help competitive use competitive help lot one time instance kapp use cover record one else would know could person able dj like jazzman say earlier malcolm catto also lot rare record well go south say oh kept say go tell malcolm say well go tell mine either get two might well take cover reveal win go get record thing rare walk local shop buy hunt self defeat really cover thing everyone else never go learn one ever go make new discovery one ever go find everything one ever go play new record aid people show people get help well show one person rare record show ten people ten people show end get ten new piece information like oppose none much sensible share knowledge really like say decent thing like like say artist make music first place give one person could keep secret really respectful think setting reissue sort run would many would sell would start thousand year ago lot popular two thousand one thousand need repress get option proportion would actually go repress every three four record put something blatantly commercial pay one every three four one commercial instance deliberately marlena shaw california soul knew would sell lot copy hand soon folky one canada thought one go buy knew people would buy would really really grateful do would really minority minority record paid majority one deliberately know go sell lot pay one know go sell lot nevertheless still deserve get release get idea blue note record actually use would deliberately something like sidewinder song father know would sell load use money order pay ornette coleman free jazz thing knew sell hardly nevertheless thought deserve place market still valid piece music go sell copy get one well go master process master release much often would go kind restoration sort process record take tape lot easy take vinyl take vinyl difficult technology pretty good program get rid crackle program get rid hiss program get rid pop get good engineer good ear get rid noise year ago lot difficult lot well get rid cue make sound half decent one issue contention get record originally sound really bad master badly mixed badly question make sound true original even sound rubbish try change use modern technology make sound would like sound back day issue always try contend never really get grip never get proper answer would know everyone get different idea know real answer official thank hi thank couple question heard rumor first start collect record thrift shop stuff something say original release print begin know mean mean actually original release reprint tape sat mean print print hear tape wrap wrong way little bit original audio signal press onto begin vinyl know sometimes hear mean original press talk single lp anything press record think happens matter way tape roll sometimes go take time happen say something say original release second release something necessarily something could record actually master cut month record tape could sat shelf come across record record release four year difference four year may print time talk hand could condition tape store think really think infer something repress little bit sound begin usually thing especially single never really repress would do different color label something different matrix number look internet look various book swiss book call funk lexicon write guy call peter wermelinger know write actual matrix number around label tell original press lot record thank also start go record label stuff go storage go old tape print usually people deal lot time individual happen band odd year ago usually private individual today rather record company record interested would small label independent may one two release really like record company occasionally record company archive tape pretty rare lot single interested nature obscure mean handful release label never developed fully fledge record company get huge back catalog would eat someone like universal tape actually follow sorry ask lot question one shot deal tape go fall apart end stressful yeah happen snap stretch fragile use year year actually tapesworses one right tape lates bad shed say process put oven bake special place bake adhesive stick actual metal particle actual base tape come apart bakes stick back together pretty effective get pretty good sound end cook reel reel tape basically oven home special place do do do transfer knackered really use do digitize kept forever permanent ever come across anything like fake somebody release something recently try make like really rare record mean like someone release something record pretend do year ago think able tell sound quality stuff record say year ago do analog equipment old microphone old technique tell mile do heard many old record occasionally might get tricked bit would pretty difficult think least record old equipment old manner old technique well would master press old way sound get thing totally different sound thing record do old day lot different ever find hear sample song know clear ever gotten legality people ever call like know mean incredible wealth knowledge sure recognize sample lot people would kind mean many people use sample people quite high profile clear like talib kweli one mention earlier clear u use sell hell lot record result clear would obviously do something mean people line exploit music release get compensate local record someone mixtape something really great scheme thing huge significance really matter really think issue never sort caught someone anything like issue people bootleg thing get interest copyright call tell sort thing yeah thing go bit generally past thing lot people little bootleg like small fly operation like copy know nothing people try sell thousand thousand copy try pas reissue legal many left people keen try something generally find lot anyway actually thing like yeah get protect copyright simple sure everyone make music release something cd someone else put without permission happy especially make lot money happy regardless old even year time hear music make year time use someone else sample reissue heard someone told told notify paid really happy someone bought really rare record put onto internet something like make available download know couple site do anyway know depends scale small scale make hell lot money really matter fun artist instance met point fact site call funk com database lot lot sound clip say look like fact record represent get paid everything like one minute clip guy actually pay make money spread world fact record exists harm like library one end spectrum find good harm hand someone literally do make money without paid copyright fee anything like quite large scale end thing think allow pretty near dear exclusivity record rare would ever put internet mean make money mean put internet yeah oppose sell record add part shop like saw website add cart whatever would ever consider sell single mp record get copyright available download service remember one idea really make sure music spent lot time uncover basically represent properly medium whether record cd download appropriate royalty filter whoever own copyright money get make cdscontractually oblige filter proper royalty people actually make music producer record company whoever own first place regardless whether release internet cd make difference format really long get royalty paid end day important thing actually would like put small command mention maybe smart pay lot money one certain particular record like maybe try find another place buy two dollar know five year ago met british guy karminsky experience maybe know yeah collectingstrange weird sound incredible strange music go store moscow actually found five record really like store quite expensive buy say wow know think buy dollar something think actually cannot pay kind price record really like know record rare difficult evaluate actually sound cost sound believe really like something really need actually sound rare certain quantity copy think smart forget record cost expect true maybe much money time something everyone get limit record people specifically say right pay ten pound twenty pound hundred pound record matter much like mean keep control finance everyone get limit want spend something may really really like record like say may limit may like another record much cost half price everyone different everyone get mean assess value much want pay something even something market value suppose record hundred pound everyone world sell five hundred mean get bargain essence like four hundred pound cheaper go rate may still bought fact limit hand might bought know could sell five hundred everyone get reason want buy stuff certain price usually people say get limit say hundred pound whatever buy record really mean much offer something really really really really want pound probably buy three pound limit never stop could go forever especially worth lot could buy justify say could sell lot everyone say get limit believe really reason last thing actually thank put marlena shaw california soul label friend tune incredible good one sure thanks question research music time frame discover anything studio technique micing technique yeah malcolm work drummer one red bull workshop couple year ago actually built studio use lot old gear whenever go together meet lot guy especially producer asks lot technique sometimes bought equipment found personally much interest busy stuff well learn quite bit especially drum placement mic placement drum definitely art lose think year basically people record band much studio like past people obviously use tape day like use lot equipment whether compressor rdqs whatever much stuff do computer lot technique lose day definitely yeah wish knew bit never really need know sort go bit head talk together whole resurgence quantic stuff like come sort try trace back sort sound think renew interest know lot friend maybe last two four year start go back seven inch sort learn discover true music quantic tru thought stuff like think certain extent lot people maybe heard seven inch first time old funk single first time captivate different sound get dynamic get digital sound cd people may like much people like wow never heard anything like sound really fresh ear really keen start look try get sort sound try record like think lot benefit sound lose year know lot way sound quite authentic nostalgic nostalgic way nostalgic heard never heard get nothing compare sound new way lot people heard music do digitally computer hearing analog record first time hearing vinyl sound totally different sound fresh sound new even though do do year year do modern context old played come wonder listen home sound quality switch radio hear digital stuff feel ear maybe lot sound really really good get inside lot think listen friend mine put new system car bass deep like ground treble sound awesome ear get inside bone feel much think technically pretty good feel term would normal music try imagine band play imagine drummer play kick drum bass player play bass low like seem real personally appreciate music properly get imagine real played people personal viewpoint music really like enjoy feel passionate human touch music like music artificially create like sound nice everything feel obviously important give back artist due everything ever situation may sort reopen old wound something like example artist ripped label year ago year ago something like come along release stuff label owner say hey want cut whatever yeah tricky sometimes occasion open worm talk someone say oh copyright owner pay money talk guitarist say oh talk drummer say start argue everything occasion instance record played earlier universal new generation one happen save money together make record record get sent distributor store somewhere along line get lose record never actually turn spent money nothing disappear somewhere even know properly press band hell lot money start really commercially successful put money venture nothing effect get completely stitch ripped whoever make record pretty tough year actually get release properly like say earlier well people expect think try get pay able record put cd appreciate put first place maybe indicative wild west attitude back day yeah pretty bad back day rule back day music business really tricky industry lot shark mean still bad obviously day lot less collection society lot less regulation go normal pay dj backhand play record radio use wit imagination hustle skill whatever get record get press first place tricky business like get record heard oppose someone else lot hustle go sorry hog mic sorry people another question artist release know say found nursing home stuff like maybe reignite opportunity tour come retirement something like wish could try organize thing like one band brings mind soul tornado base akron ohio two brother one played bass played organ say look get together bring england record paid one guy california paid get together hurdle everything main problem money end day minority music go sell shitloads copy go make million pound able get band afford fly way uk get gig make cost effective easy try sum really add unfortunately get maybe one person say singer even go get one two gig forte promote another cat fish altogether enough able promote concert band gig something else entirely much like get people whole band even band singer quite difficult thing best able basically pas detail people adrian gibson jazz café one main people interested sort thing say look want get number give call get come november get robert moore soul singer florida come perform help pay adrian get record speedometer actually put single well try get two gig instead one much intention easy especially know mostly plane flight everything expense involve otherwise love get people people work really well like marlena shaw come regularly people like spanky wilson quantic get involve gwen mccrae come quite lot get quite good reputation able come uk little mini tour go europe like say something get time really get involve curious know past number year quite mess old jazz label like impulse blue note verve like open back catalog remixes stuff wonder concept happy let go sort sacrilege actually heard would really really know anything keep music alive record make year ago mean say overlook heard new far concerned whether record yesterday year ago lot people complain old music say sound new sound modern anything heard really say old music still would new ear need modern touch able get people ear think good thing sense certainly make people realize old music even modernize may turn people look back past see stuff back appreciate well especially hear side side situation material put jazzman come master tape people interested step quantic remix first song played earlier sometimes feel like motherless child quantic remix thing do sense people ask u thing like generally really time follow quite honestly many thing go project people say remix really top agenda get much work keep put new thing rather remixing old thing think whole new format label put want really really time go direction cheer imagine involve pretty serious record trade year get good story record trade well trade nature really good record buying story find horde record go really cheap guy know something trade people know sense trading record pretty much know go trade really rare record something rubbish vice versa probably best record find ever master tape mickey soul generation found texas one even knew exist get pull say complete album one thing make sink knee heart start pump like found whole album legendary band one knew exist pretty good find dig amaze sort thing happens buying record know ripped like everyone else every time ripped good result find stuff something worth lot money guy want five dollar something come ethic like say earlier artist sell record pay cheap money stuff give proper price way guy actually business sell record like store dealer want five dollar
