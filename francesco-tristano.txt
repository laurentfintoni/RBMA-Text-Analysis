stress last night brushing classical music knowledge write say play composer look wikipedia composer thought many version song write back within five minute say yeah play people could play begin play something wurlitzer something old school speak maybe sound bit new mind wurlitzer miss c tune think go okay way please welcome francesco tristano applause music francesco tristano play orlando gibbon applause piece orlando gibbon english composer mid th century bach definitely century bach special mind bio think mention website particular influence love harmony tend think old music something different new music standard time standard harmony rhythm necessarily think sound like plaid sound like bach part modal follow tonal system follow modal system plaid use mode well harmonic language always interest early age always love old music problem piano time write piano piano time certainly write wurlitzer make quite point thing write piano one first album first electronic speak album call piano lot piece piano seem like important idea take thing put context different instrument see happen yes good point piano beautiful instrument huge design impressive big image piano image th century music maybe high scale salon parisian style maybe wig think wrong image piano appear little crazy instrument composer want use big crazy anything bach like probably saw early prototype good tend like music old time piano even exist contemporary music piano longer valid instrument like techno example extreme repertoire play old stuff try something new always idea piano instrument future always become one century use instrument composer bach want touch interested century later every hotshot composer pianist use piano main source expression obviously hotshot composer use lot baggage put upon piano especially within popular culture come hear romantic quaint wig wear salon thing read interview say see piano percussion instrument think big break term think wonder point epiphany piano romantic quaint thing sort thing early immediate thing want drummer happen piano home probably strategic move mom want play drum suppose first step piano try imitate drum sort play cluster low register picture walk foot keyboard eventually get drum set soon do practise go basement played drum whole afternoon mum make put basement yeah get drum set though uncle cool uncle yes piano definitely percussion instrument mechanic instrument mechanic actually point wurlitzer see press key whole mechanism end whole bunch back forth hammer hit string cannot really control like attack decay piano changeable always go keyboard instrument emulate vibrato play sort like clavichord believe bach favourite keyboard instrument touch like nice synthesizer press key whatever finger later hear piano react kind stupid instrument term attack percussion base cool thing piano create illusion many instrument create illusion string instrument create illusion wind instrument course instrumental keyboard sound bring lead believe fact synthesizer know study classical music suppose non classical city new york classic necessarily classical realize could kind synthesizer especially start go inside piano fiddle around overtone basically resonance filter depend much press string effect like cut pedal like release sustain really sort ancestral synthesizer even though say normal classical upbringing outsider view go juilliard practise classical cd parent typical taskmaster practice two three four hour day grow crack whip speak something immediately take force anything enjoy much take realize want around knew go use piano way sure exactly guess confuse mother always want something else study classical music free hour improvise jazz try digest real book chord change chorus stuff go new york get electronic music want want explore try understand jazz already fade jazz project go drop get turntable mix board gear really dipped always idea combine piano sound thought piano sound could still evolve something else basic design piano design evolve year think always year fact japan summer yamaha go see yamaha factory technology use fabricate piano unbelievable new model new prototype come every year new technology new mechanical instrument new pedal constant evolution remember say record last album detroit found piano like much wait many month become available record album every piano like every guitar every whatever sound little bit different lot different think thing big travel instrument lucky half ton put plane complicate detroit one instrument thought could great album wait year available available time piano brought carl craig studio planet e become piano auditorium week happy could get piano basically foremost inspiration album sound piano different piano saw detroit become geeky piano let ok fundamentally steinway important brand two factory one hamburg one new york market strictly divide find hamburg steinway u maybe current new york steinway different design recognize edgier keyboard hamburg round different bass register find new york steinway much slam bass music need like say percussion instrument need bass register go record planet e go need definitely fight instrument studio synthesizer effect box good piano know right away play one chord like yeah sometimes stuck bad piano go go record album new york get first time talk discover techno earlier visit new york teenager stay friend apartment mom upper west side walk around play piano concerto time walk juilliard school say could cool place hang study three year later accepted term conservatory want conserve something suppose conserve tradition luggage call also time conservatory new york city study decently practice lot always part good student yes suppose main thing conservatory try exactly opposite conservative person sense juilliard great basically one exam get one exam get want great music lab example seem interest one exam get one exam get still conservative whatever want everyone really take advantage would say everybody relative term found great people juilliard met piano partner ramus khalifé team project aufgang kind alter ego connect many level basically spend afternoon improvise do class listen lot techno time go practice room improvise hour constant bpm sort thing people walk go happen walk matter conservative people really matter find conservative people anywhere find jazz find electronic music find classical music try take everything new york city give electronic music fact electronic music kind limited right new york city maybe little well year ago arrive year right around time giuliani come tail end really powerful moment club culture new york sad moment suppose club culture many bar club license revoke dance even though dj remember east village night pump music great vibe start move dance dance interest put censorship people also give music place could dance place meant place call vinyl danny tenaglia beyourself never met learn much set would go ten hour vinyl alcohol licence alcohol european new york seem completely extravagant probably underage anyway listen set try figure tune realize detroit techno prominent try get cd lp student red bull music academy know danny tenaglia around time probably one best teacher ten hour set one best teacher time play anything throughout set disco house techno place imagine hard figure people go go dj booth ask process say red bull music academy wish wish student guy really sometimes go ramus friend sometimes go listen even dance listen try understand groove listen new way way think music still fight good sense bad sense still separate element harmony rhythm melody bass basically layer musical element whereas electronic music relative sound note guess immediately appeal kind tell jumbled together melody harmony switch definitely good techno track harmony basically function rhythmic impulse thing matter harmony hear could something else still fulfills purpose give rhythmic pulse track always attract thing opposite end spectrum get way course people like john cage already predictedmusic would longer note layer bass harmony melody would sound composer would sound artist call lecture john cage probably year ahead way try approach music play track one rendition electronic track three point anyone recognizes piano music francesco tristano andover applause autechre andover tell thing chose rearrange replay guess first question would would say cover say rendition extraordinary rendition laugh detroit techno track one unrelated chose classic jeff mill bell derrick may string life basically indicate album could piano album first time publish piece include techno classic one idm classic suppose want hint direction album target try recollection classic include piece say electronic music even though play piano put bell doubt way version carl craig music played technology lot played technology carnegie hall nice think first time carl music perform carnegie hall program played frescobaldi played yesterday night piece also first time perform carnegie hall see sometimes extreme meet concrete situation like institution target program one repertoire leave extreme completely get point classical career number thing various classical label saw say go add bell tonight pure provocation perhaps let well set agenda say go play frescobaldi last minute improvise play bell usually way around teacher say tell best joke first think best joke stuff electronically driven stuff start finish frescobaldi think really nice way discover old music new context like didyesterday frescobaldi sort come piece hello nobody monitor nobody tell stage place freedom like complete artistic freedom place afraid quite contrary space go far problem promoter sometimes classical promoter strict idea want sometimes negotiate meet halfway also want stuff always great experience classical audience hearing example string life carl craig technology think audience never underestimated sure promoter put listing audience best sometimes surprised elderly people come show say piece play inside piano string life composer know played inside piano composer probably even know played piece shock lady say work get score score well listen try version like term version much rendition maybe everything version even original string life version several original version derrick may original idea cannot capture capture sound capture score original string life version go circle version version version think exactly old composer like bach vivaldi frescobaldi great remixers time bach great remixer heard theme like italian composer picked use music even credit original composer say concerto basically remix one analogy baroque age time definitely age remix string life first one decide piano suppose track say way one one thing sorry miss whole techno thing happen lateearlyyoung get earlyok classic already go go pass heard string life remember know know tune know discover title even think go one carl dj set played melody stuck mind research remember found internet site cellphone ring one string life oh string life use ringtone never download ringtone site like harmony piece harmony appeal want something gibbon harmony guy laugh harmony guy guess percussive guy actually harmony surprising second chord string life really surprising know still play string life wurlitzer transformation two chord world apart short time span suppose make want use know derrick background well seem like chord change non composer would make oh sound kind nice someone classically train would never think make connection perhaps maybe played string life immediately go piano end something come time felt like handle piece play inside piano already string life seem like cool end version unfortunately vinyl release ran room cut part suppose play live revenge make part especially long love play much gear piano yesterday really reach piano way use clear range sound metal wood even get computer midi controller vinyl part original release label release infiné french label seem like one label electronic world would open something like get hooked person talk label drive force behind go road one show paris think show played mixed program old music bach think finish program string life show guy alexandre cazac come say string life great want set label time time introduce team agoria record first version string life pretty soon version album record bit later well piano well setting general andover thing listen hear electronic stuff go background album place come play start play software instrument bring fold ago always try expand sound piano keyboard love people like joe zawinul example watch videoskeyboardist weather report yes actually classical keyboardist bebop pianist cannonball adderley met mile go way never played less six keyboard synthesizer piece furniture behind basically like furniture sound synthesizer keyboard bring rack rack two meter high something thought fascinate switch sound easily try build language way combine different sound juilliard great music lab amaze old gear completely fell love yamaha dx basic version start use make track student idea go beyond piano composition production thing whether sit table write music paper computer program think difference difference try arrange perform live still play piano attractive way loop stuff love play loop issue play thing might notice yesterday loop something real time play thing alive much press record play loop piano whole bunch piano loop played autechre tune edit six minute could play minute basically always thing look good part cut edit together must hard play loop say find quite easy easy hard love play loop issue people aufgang example band ramus like play loop play free stuff issue play bassline thing program something record one bar thing loop go static actually record even midi record bassline record whole track record live six minute track play six minute track play much live loop little rhythmic program different thing also need quantize right basslines much groovier think much appeal always fall spot within bar move little bit machine think machine yet play bassline even though thing go move time think beneficial track longer loop play live let play track aufgang mention couple time already channel sonar music aufgang sonar fine record store sonar applause aufgang first played correct correct base memory first performance actually write first performance one first piece tell freedom drummer finally great first version aufgang drum set two piano electronics year aymeric guy program guy want use drum great drummer played cassius whole bunch rap artist france phoenix also drummer phoenix soon use drum set first date holland four year ago energy double onstage really drum hold thing together play without click always like play click live midi stuff go onstage aymeric drummer click follow hold together really freedom drum set onstage really start obviously want project ramus friend school guide principle behind whole thing guess take u figure first album come together three four year play together compose try find sound add drum whole different thing guess moment realize something really yeah composition tune try make would free live project first album take come together drum one large leap sound work behind door computer send file aymeric sends new basslines ramus compose piano stuff top record send back maybe get together complicate live three different country see often always intense way work space paris meet occasionally record second album work think different sense really produce piano played live drum played live rest pretty much laid studio know midi think new album much live feel hear moment sound rocky could sound drum general soon drummer get aymeric like machine also like rock drummer tell settle sometimes yeah hard band come classical background negotiate relief relief together vibe anything could happen invincible whereas alone tour always different project alone travel alone prepare alone concentrate alone prepare brother relief good vibe small tour month ago nothing could go wrong lot collaboration anyway work carl craig work moritz von oswald sometimes together let talk carl first go see dj met afterwards say hello think infiné introduce two correct yes alexandre year unofficially met club holland think alex mind story go say think two need talk think thought go happen carl remember go ramus say guy come gig say yeah alex precise goal knew listen lot carl music time met knew stuff heart say heart mean could play stuff really music guess six month later go detroit first time work melody remix first collaboration original piano take melody take classical way necessarily close micing ambient micing carl like use take remix well come detroit go detroit record piano part bass part make two remixes first thing start work together innerzone orchestra one thing big thing orchestra call versus evolve since think video still online performance paris electronics play piano enormous orchestra play stuff must pretty special lot work spent two month arrange stuff orchestra get conductor project one week rehearsal come together day show really orchestra work electronic musician easy also whole bunch technical thing need coordinate like sound play amplify play onstage monitor click track click track conductor click track dance end show onstage look like conduct great time great experience repeat definitely evolve project version germany year played couple show conduct orchestra play much freely kind dj set carl moritz time orchestra come go continuous mix music surprising thing carl work surprising know great personality think small think techno necessarily comparison drawn mile davis definitely think jazz go beyond kind personality important art also artist around thing people complicate make happen first start work classical musician adapt language talk groove idea groove mean talk feel thing make sense write note paper translator language speak term learn lot process definitely kind mediator two world conductor great job make happen orchestra basically get know orchestra musician yet another special breed classical musician sometimes really hard make happen also love play loop orchestra hate play loop one bar write say time get kind upset bar beat stop thing say beat yeah already played time yeah go laugh moritz von oswald do production word use describe do record bachcage one credit enchant auricle mean mystery secret moritz work record couple time one auricle last bachcage produce full mystery auricle bio come spontaneously whole bunch piano sample live piano record kind direct antagonist piano piano record play live auricle end live piano sample mix inside box basically stereo file sound okay sound engineer definitely master engineer count moritz make sound good think definitely master job master job basically mean eqing maybe little bit compress manage feature part original process isolate several frequency whole track becomes make kind d version d track bachcage present begin project played music bach cage piece mine short one pleasure play yesterday student onstage moritz set mics process music together definitely hear moritz von oswald touch bachcage auricle freedom play something bachcage hear moritz one look laptop music start stop music francesco tristano landscape applause piece john cage call landscape basically mics piano use half maybe regular mix way record five mics go whole sidechain processing box heavy ring modulator moritz von oswald delay course reverb phaser basically live post production record take live moritz processing do second layer important record first time afraid use processing tool classical production john cage necessarily classical composer label classical label come deutsche grammophon think important note also go record store john cage classical section current thing use ring modulators record classical piano album exactly previous album music idiosynkrasi piece played yesterday second album guess third album return think told difference play classical music say classical really quote even know mean think use anachronistic way word classical fairly recent year old use describe music year later call music even year ago classical classical really contemporary way difference play music composer another time play music sound piano always process always mostly think one way evolve sound piano something else relationship time rock production techno production use machine classic jazz reason take long get classical stuff classical industry also get allow something like deutsche grammophon say record breakthrough way felt like pass place like say whole electronic education come classical education guess know combine two fact difference whether play piece bach music take long think natural organic process try integrate thing learn try define sound pianist spend lot time work sound analogically fingertip weight elbow arm back important part piano go sound mics pick something completely different send mics processing box get something totally different get something personal suppose find sound describes best interest play call role play game classical music interpret something past old way new way use technology definitely help direction must also big deal side moritz classical record take convincing record label bring guy trust already do record guess carl yeah compose start want together auricle though entirely thing sort remix project necessarily classical playlist moritz totally excite guess kind challenge techno dub producer produce music bach love completely crazy idea moritz want go say maybe something light say moritz want ring modulator turn turn give special flavor happy play guy yesterday piece short excerpt say excerpt cut original record one half minute remix lawrence know want listen real quick sure also deutsche grammophon music francesco tristano tristano introit lawrence remix lawrence applause anyone last night immediately recognize little melodic riff find interest lawrence give chance mix john cage piece bach piece chose fascinate right yeah happy chose introit think piece kind work progress say every original piece already version previous idea cannot fully grasp head composer producer obviously record lot effort go edit master already piece go sound different different shape different structure remixing people one version collaboration another version think last night version probably favourite version far think could roll another half hour still work piece still work hello first piece played last night composition five six year old keep try make evolve go place one way add program sequence way get people remix know track idiosynkrasia say do thing think bring album laugh version version know idiosynkrasia set deadline someone give ok version finish guess really want make point bring record music do begin music begin life music put record understand thing understand process make music would bad sit back say hey music do someone want remix cool go touch think begin bring record think end medium say good record bad record well last one good last one actually one long process record go related previous one hint towards next one basically one long work progress definitely definitive version related one thing say interviewed six month ago great composer find language define language wonder feel like get find language work progress determine whether found language start thing year ago try combine sound piano sound electronic music love love sound piano love techno impression still lot still impression find idiosyncratic thing music suppose good thing do explore idea classical repertoire next project could completely different towards future past aesthetic still go kind like sound research thing get idea try develop bring record help put milestone progress development way take last word always little surprised press say album new thing finish think way album one step whatever music bach cage seem unlikely bedfellow mind connection want put next album one conviction old music shield contemporary music fact contemporary music plural lot stuff like put juxtaposition old new continuous way fact bachcage like dj set music cage bach first statement old music actually part language go hear way go hear late techno production cage bach definitely connect certain level minimalist definitely bach one first great minimalist something similar way write score basic score indication music title maybe word two bach even write word title music connect rhythmic level use definite rhythmic form rhythmic pattern bach music especially instrumental music base dance baroque form dance seem completely like sarabande would like dance sarabande idea dance sarabande suppose year ago people know sarabande know house track dubstep whatever dance want call john cage us pattern strict piece listen landscape sound like dreamy thing sort ambient stuff actually rhythmic structure completely define remember exactly completely separate several section total amount beat sum previous section kind crazy organization rhythm definitely comparable bach last least spiritual sense abstract kind universal listen music bach cage need information transport somewhere know kind feel get really high understand human want philosophize much bach cage four letter also first name johann sebastian bach john cage analogy open question want ask recently played space ibiza carl first time played club environment like grand piano already space carl previous season repeat play club lot rare grand piano fact also closing party luciano pacha vagabundos piano complicate stage small suppose space easy big stage good stage space besides dj booth pacha complicate luciano point dj booth crowd meter opposite side barely saw try connect music love play club yesterday kind hybrid thing usually either play piano recital seat hall could amplify could electronics necessarily beat dance techno live set dancefloor club keyboard usually two three keyboard plus little machine computer yesterday bit hybrid kind concert also play beat usually concert hall soundsystem concert hall mostly adapt subby music go easy speaker ideal place saw people sit move chair quite comfortable people stand maybe want sit place feel ideal format hear complement well vital switch play different environment think every hall ideal long try get feel vibe connect audience whether quiet audience sit chair crazy audience dance tomorrow complementary love go back forth also hybrid format interest maybe new sensation really know expect fact know expect know want play adapt tracklist mind start play yesterday completely change throughout show feel course lead grand finale student speak student anyone question like ask two question first talk history piano knowledge piano first invent set tune scale time people tune piano explore different tune system stick classic tone system right format since bach onwards bach distinctive tune system tune profession right play around eventually break piano tune much work tuner crazy guy absolutely willing experiment tune get antique tuning relationship interval specific key example tell special tuner know look go play music frescobaldi key f major minor c major think second start tune every modulation big event relationship interval shock hear way go completely different way tune quarter tone go traditional arab scale go completely crazy tune system everything possible tune need tuner thank secondly exploration electronica piano classical music say word techno lot mean really interested work beat pattern piano like say percussive instrument talk complex percussive thing interest come electronic part producer work seem stick format interest something complicate different definitely issue love cool thing four equal beat much beat kickdrum accentuate every beat harmonically piano pretty much syncopate much space beat make groove happen like limit anything common denominator classical music certain figure like alberti bass show briefly something like play wurlitzer classical music hear something like always always different definitely like abstract beat work people like sutekh heavy four floor definitely also sound music beat piano ambient property need beat spacey play drum feel last year evolution rhythm beat culture come people play drum common perception among drummer electronic producer programmer evolve beat culture feel harmony interest point absolutely agree think get machine drummachines also synthesizer way organic musician play change absolutely say specific chord progression could non composer basically play around find chord find interest becomes another language becomes new kind thing detroit techno example hear lot pentatonic stuff laid pretty easily black key example becomes specific sound way listen necessarily hear pentatonic scale hear new conglomerate pitch determine harmony piece go sure far go analogy think carl craig great harmonizer example get great harmony mad mike underground resistance gospel jazz background evolution linear move hand inch basically circle go back forward becomes much richer harmonic language become much richer rhythmic language since advent beat machine stuff like think amplify field learn think definitely right beatboxing change lot perception rhythmic structure come organic drum count among guy like say play drum piano like play drum couple question first version landscape record studio berlin august listen little even know get version computer totally uncredited blew away played even sample couple time hope problem laugh problem might one john cage publisher laugh second ever see move away piano completely dive deeper synthesize sound maybe even harmonic sample yeah definitely ultimately project combine sound electronic acoustic realm eventually bring piano already bring piano many element count piano happy piano stage feel home laptop dy midi controller go away power whatever piano still sound nice companion onstage always sound matter happens bomb matter always sound piano sound titanic go think yeah definitely probably notice play piano play much play lot loop always solo right hand chorus minimalistic approach guess extreme end would play piano anymore know could future notice yesterday show quite lot emotional content music quite lot dissonance well come interest dissonance within sort music interest question reading lecture john cage day say old way compose discern consonance dissonance new way compose discern organize sound versus noise call noise could unorganized chaotic sound whatnot dissonance dissonant surprising everything dissonant longer dissonant becomes consonant like work simple harmony simple chord major trial minor trial sometimes seventh point like break like break set marker introduce dissonance consonant stuff transform next part way see suppose spontaneous really calculate go come program kind lot dissonance whatever play piano say like free play live like play hand sometimes see eq something right hand still play consonance ear speak nowadays hear everything different hear large range music nothing shock anymore dissonant stuff shock heard like go way play lot please harmony play something different kind shock first piece played tonight gibbon way start pretty soft minor sudden go completely necessarily dissonant progression within tonal structure music surprise like create new context way listen music even old music especially old music new music really shock anymore old music difficult shock nowadays know last time shock heard something think refresh listen old stuff piece played yesterday year old dissonant time get think well maybe wall old new illusion thanks anyone else question well thank much francesco
