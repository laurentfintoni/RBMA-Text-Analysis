DJ Rekha
So let’s start with little Bappi Lahiri, baby Bappi Lahiri. Let’s talk about baby Bappi Lahiri. So tell me, what was your first encounter with music? First time.
Bappi Lahiri
My life is dedicated to music, and you know my song is “I’m a Disco Dancer.” That song... Zindagi Mera Gaana. Life is my music. Everything is my music. But from my childhood I was playing tabla, you know, very, very international star [inaudible]. Like that I was playing from my childhood.
DJ Rekha
How long were you when you started playing the tabla?
Bappi Lahiri
I can’t remember.
DJ Rekha
Three, four...
Bappi Lahiri
Three years, four years... I can’t remember. My mother told me I was very small. Anyway, five years I started my, little I can recollect Lata Mangeshkar-ji, she blessed me. She told my father, mister Aparesh Lahiri, you should go... You should come to Pundit Samta Prasadji, he’s a classical tabla player. And first I started guru Pundit Samta Prasad. And this started my career as a tabla player. Then basically, slowly, slowly, slowly I was in piano, then starting composition.
DJ Rekha
And this is in Calcutta? Where you...
Bappi Lahiri
Kolkata, Kolkata. I born in Kolkata. And at the age of 11 years I started the composition, as a composer, and I composed a song. My father Mr. Lahiri sang, Aparesh Lahiri. Then I came back to... Again and film one film, Bengali film started Dadu. Dadu means “grandfather.”
DJ Rekha
Right.
Bappi Lahiri
That’s... This is my starting my career. Then I came to Mumbai, the Bollywood.
DJ Rekha
And your father was a music director in Bengali film.
Bappi Lahiri
Yes. A music writer, and he has sang so many film. But my family is like... My mother Bansari Lahiri she was a big classical singer. I know classical melody, folk song, everything. But slowly, slowly, slowly, when I came to Mumbai I started my career at Zakhmee.
DJ Rekha
Yes.
Bappi Lahiri
What you have said, “Nothing is Impossible.”
DJ Rekha
So... Yes, so...
Bappi Lahiri
That is something, fantastic work. 
DJ Rekha
Let’s... We’ll get to that... Yeah, why don’t we just play that for a second now, that song.
[music: Kishore Kumar, Mohd. Rafi and Bappi Lahiri – “Nothing is Impossible”]
So when you moved to Mumbai, you were started as a playback singer, right? You were singing first?
Bappi Lahiri
No, no, no, no.
DJ Rekha
Or you were composing as well?
Bappi Lahiri
I’m a composer first.
DJ Rekha
First composer.
Bappi Lahiri
First composer, and this is the song I used first time the Moog synthesizer, Moog.
DJ Rekha
Moog.
Bappi Lahiri
And the Roland synthesizer Moog. And the guitar like the Beatles were playing like this... And this is my just journey started.
DJ Rekha
So what was the first...
Bappi Lahiri
That time Bappi Lahiri’s nothing. But Zakhmee become biggest hit...
DJ Rekha
So what was your idea around creating the song? So this song is made in 1972?
Bappi Lahiri
Three.
DJ Rekha
Three. ’73. So this is almost pre-disco, but it has a very disco sound to it.
Bappi Lahiri
This is rock style.
DJ Rekha
Rock song. So where did you... Did you compose it in the studio? Or at home? And then you had...
Bappi Lahiri
No, no, no, studio. Live musician.
DJ Rekha
Live musicians.
Bappi Lahiri
No, no…
DJ Rekha
How many musicians were there?
Bappi Lahiri
Oh my gosh.
DJ Rekha
So many, right?
Bappi Lahiri
60 to 80 musicians.
DJ Rekha
60 to 80 musicians.
Bappi Lahiri
Live musicians.
DJ Rekha
So they’re playing all the parts live.
Bappi Lahiri
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
DJ Rekha
OK. And then there’s somebody writing the lyrics?
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, I’ve got my four assistant. And lyric writer is different. And like, so many lyric writer working with me.
DJ Rekha
So what was your idea around the song to make it sound very... It sounds as we would say... It sounds very Western. And the song is called “Nothing is Impossible.”
Bappi Lahiri
This song is Western, but other song is very, very melodious.
DJ Rekha
Right.
Bappi Lahiri
Very soft music, like romantic melody. Like so many songs I made. Very much romantic.
DJ Rekha
Sure. So when you compose, you compose on the piano? Or harmonium?
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, harmonium.
DJ Rekha
Harmonium.
Bappi Lahiri
Piano, harmonium, both.
DJ Rekha
OK.
Bappi Lahiri
And my one song was after Zakhmee, was a greatest hit called “Chalte Chalte” sung by Kishore Kumar. Immortal. Now also, is Asian everybody knows this song.
DJ Rekha
Right.
Bappi Lahiri
Chalte Chalte Khabi Alvida Na Kahena. 
DJ Rekha
So...
Bappi Lahiri
“Don’t say goodbye.”
DJ Rekha
Right. So in terms of working with these greats, you were a young composer in Bollywood, these people are much respected. It’s your uncle. What was it like in terms of producing and working with them? In terms of how to get them to get the performance...
Bappi Lahiri
I blessed by Kishore Kumar, my uncle, and of course Lata Mangeshkar-ji. And after that my mother, other singer, other icon of Bollywood industry. They’re all fantastic singer, and they blessed me and they loved me. Because I was so young at the time, you know, like my age is 19, 20 years, 20, 21 years this song. “Nothing is Impossible.” And so long innings is going on, but I always remember their blessing. Because what I am today, blessing of this all the singers, superstar singers.
DJ Rekha
Yeah. So what’s the different between working with them and working with... You worked with also a lot of newer artists when you developed your career, what’s the different in terms of the recording process? Is there anything different? What’s a challenge as a producer?
Bappi Lahiri
Kishore Kumar...
DJ Rekha
Tell us some good stories.
Bappi Lahiri
Kishore Kumar... Kishore Kumar... My... One of my saddest things in my life, Kishore Kumar wants to sing English version of “Chalte Chalte”…
DJ Rekha
OK.
Bappi Lahiri
Was a very big fan of Elvis. I was also definitely an Elvis Presley fan…
DJ Rekha
I can see it.
Bappi Lahiri
Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole. But I... When... Last meeting he told me, “Bappi, why you want to sing some English song?” [sings] He wants to do this song, in English. Anyway, very sad... Last song he sang for me. Next day he... What happened do you know? There’s a so great singer like Lata-ji, Kishore Kumar. Sitution, you understand sitution?
DJ Rekha
Yes.
Bappi Lahiri
I am a songwriter.
DJ Rekha
Yes, yes.
Bappi Lahiri
Some sad sitution, some romantic, some dancing, some Indian type of dancing... If I explain to them, the song, I compose 50 percent. After they are singing, it’s a 100 percent.
DJ Rekha
So they were part of the process.
Bappi Lahiri
Fantastic.
DJ Rekha
So they added to the song…
Bappi Lahiri
Today, I’m missing all the golden era. The disco golden era.
DJ Rekha
So today’s singers, not the same kind…
Bappi Lahiri
No. Definitely, they’re good, I’m also singing now, but... Today’s singing is good, but nothing compares to then. No way. Kishore Kumar, Lata-ji…
DJ Rekha
So when you were growing up and you heard folk songs, classical music, were you also exposed to American music or Western music.
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, yes.
DJ Rekha
Where did you listen to that? What was the first non-Indian song? Do you remember?
Bappi Lahiri
Oh my god. My favorite song at the age of 16 years, a film called Hatari! [sings melody].
DJ Rekha
Yes.
Bappi Lahiri
You know Hatari! film? Super rich soundtrack. Then Shadows, fantastic. I loved Shadows. The musical. Of course [inaudible], there’s a lot of songs, a lot of songs, my god. “Come September,” was very big in India [sings melody]. You know like, this type of music inspired me very much. After that you know, I started my career. Some romantic songs, very very big... You know, the symphony orchestra, I love the symphony, Mozart, Beethoven, everybody.
DJ Rekha
Yes. Was it easy to get instruments? Like in India, it was very hard sometimes…
Bappi Lahiri
No, no. 
DJ Rekha
But you guys had access to all the synthesizers and everything. 
Bappi Lahiri
In India, always violins, cellos, double bass, bass guitar…
DJ Rekha
Electronics, though?
Bappi Lahiri
Electronics? I bought.
DJ Rekha
You bought them.
Bappi Lahiri
The changes in India... That is a separate story. The disco era, I bought in India.
DJ Rekha
Yes, yes. That’s different. So, is there anyone that you worked with... So, in addition to the soundtracks and the movies, you did your own solo albums too.
Bappi Lahiri
Yes.
DJ Rekha
So why…
Bappi Lahiri
Non-film.
DJ Rekha
Non-film. So if you’re doing all these great films and you’re working with these great artists, why did you want to do other albums?
Bappi Lahiri
After that, from the ’80s, I started a non-film album. I started first composing in Abbey Road studio in London.
DJ Rekha
Abbey Road.
Bappi Lahiri
Abbey Road.
DJ Rekha
You might have heard of it.
Bappi Lahiri
You know? In Abbey Road you know the old George Harrison…
DJ Rekha
Yes. The Beatles.
Bappi Lahiri
All the songs they have recorded.
DJ Rekha
George Martin.
Bappi Lahiri
I started recording, in Abbey Road studio, Indian songs. The album called Superuna, a Bangladesh super rich song…
DJ Rekha
Runa Laila.
Bappi Lahiri
Runa Laila, right. Very big hit back then. On release, she has got a Platinum disc. I sang and composed. Produced by EMI. And after that, I had recorded so many albums.
DJ Rekha
Right. So just to correct the intro, the intro said in a very authoritative British voice that Bappi-ji has recorded over 400 albums, but that’s not true. It’s almost 600, right?
Bappi Lahiri
650.
DJ Rekha
600 albums. So that’s not too shabby.
Bappi Lahiri
And in the Guinness book also, I have released, by the grace of god, and being a god believer, I’m in the Guinness book for 37 films released in one year, in ’87.
DJ Rekha
Wow. 37.
Bappi Lahiri
37 films in one year.
DJ Rekha
I can’t watch 37 films in a year. So, you do so many things. You’re producing, you’re singing, you’re singing a lot, and you’re performing. Which is your favorite thing. What do you like to do the most?
Bappi Lahiri
Good question.
DJ Rekha
Thank you. I try.
Bappi Lahiri
Definitely first of all, I thank my fans. They love my voice, like singing, like performing, and my composition. Lot of composers there in India, they can sing. But I have sang so many songs, so many super rich songs, in over like... 1,000, 2,000, super rich songs I have sang myself. Latest like “Ooh La La”, like [inaudible], “O Sona,” and latest “Tamma Tamma” and “Badrinath Ki Dulhania.”
DJ Rekha
So which one do you like the best? What’s the difference between singing it, writing it, performing it…
Bappi Lahiri
Composition, composition definitely is the first thing of my life. I am a composer first. Then singing. Slowly I sang all the heroes, and I want to tell all my fans everywhere sitting here, I’m the only composer I’ve sang for two generations. Two generations. Five top superstar in India. Like, Amitabh Bachchan…
DJ Rekha
Let’s name them. Gimme the five. Amitabh Bachchan, Jeetendra…
Bappi Lahiri
Dev Anand.
DJ Rekha
Dev Anand.
Bappi Lahiri
Sunil Dutt.
DJ Rekha
Sunil Dutt. Which was the first... So the first image we saw, that was Sunil Dutt.
Bappi Lahiri
Sunil Dutt. “Tamma Tamma.”
DJ Rekha
Right right.
Bappi Lahiri
Jeetendra.
DJ Rekha
Jeetendra.
Bappi Lahiri
Tusshar Kapoor. “Ooh La La.”
DJ Rekha
Right and Mithoon.
Bappi Lahiri
Mithoon.
DJ Rekha
Of course.
Bappi Lahiri
Mithoon is the only one, because Mithoon’s father was not a superstar. He was the only one from Calcutta.
DJ Rekha
Just a star.
Bappi Lahiri
And become a superstar. And he danced so well in the disco era. Undoubtedly very much so. Bappi and Mithoon is a combination.
DJ Rekha
Yes. Undeniable. So, so, when was the first time you felt that... You said before, that was before you were Bappi Lahiri. When did become Bappi Lahiri? When did Bappi Lahiri happen?
Bappi Lahiri
Bappi Lahiri is in like... ’80s? ’70s? My composition and my singing like... one song was there, Vinod Khanna was very superstar. “Bombay Se Aya Mera Dost,” I sang, and I composed. ’80s Bappi Lahiri is really dominant, full valued.
DJ Rekha
Full Bollywood, full. And then, when did you start wearing the gold?
Bappi Lahiri
Gold? I’m telling you, the gold is my lucky. Everybody asking me, “Bappi Lahiri is a golden boy,” and I’m telling... Listen. When Elvis Presley I have seen. I’ve seen the photographs. His dark glasses, his chain with the cross, the bracelet, I have seen. From my childhood, my feeling... My name will be like Bappi Lahiri, established all over the world, than I have to something to my image. You understand? Now, nobody can wear gold, because everybody knows if you wear gold that means you are copying Bappi Lahiri.
DJ Rekha
That’s right. That’s right.
Bappi Lahiri
And now so many star singers, they’re wearing dark glasses. And everyone is laughing at Bappi wearing dark glasses.
DJ Rekha
It’s all I got.
Bappi Lahiri
And you’re looking very nice.
DJ Rekha
Thank you. How many chains is this? So many. Which is your favorite one?
Bappi Lahiri
Chains are all my god.
DJ Rekha
OK.
Bappi Lahiri
I believe in all god. I have got Ganapati Ganesha.
DJ Rekha
Ganesha is... Remover of obstacles.
Bappi Lahiri
Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.
Bappi Lahiri
That’s as far as my...
Bappi Lahiri
And just now, I have released my album, Divine Power is just submission to Grammy.
DJ Rekha
Oh.
Bappi Lahiri
Bappi Lahiri is the disco king, disco dancer, you know, so many things. But this time, this year, I have sang totally new age album, Divine Power. You just hear the song in iTunes. You love it. I totally... Totally. You know, you lost... You feel something.
DJ Rekha

Bappi Lahiri
And all my things are Hare Krishna and Balagen. All the gods.
DJ Rekha
And here, also... The Vatican City.
DJ Rekha

Bappi Lahiri

DJ Rekha
That’s the beauty of Hinduism.
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, I believe in all gods.
DJ Rekha
Open for business all the time [laughter].
Bappi Lahiri
I believe in... And I believe... First of all, the human is the one. World, peace, love, and harmony. I am making album. Making it about world, peace, love. We are one. Because every human... They have got something to... Separate religion. I respect all religion.
DJ Rekha
Yes, yes. Absolutely.
Bappi Lahiri
This is my calling. My principle. And so I... Buddha, Krishna, Allah, Jesus. Everybody. Every. Everything.
DJ Rekha
So...
Bappi Lahiri
They are power, I am here. That’s all.
DJ Rekha
That’s great. Speaking of powerful and religion and things to worship, tell us about Michael Jackson.
Bappi Lahiri
Ah.
DJ Rekha
Yeah, so tell us about Michael Jackson.
Bappi Lahiri
First of all, I missed so much, you know. Michael Jackson... He came to Bombay, Mumbai.
DJ Rekha
In 198... What year was it?
Bappi Lahiri
’91.
DJ Rekha
’91.
Bappi Lahiri
’91 or… I just forget. First time he’s played big concert in Mumbai. And somehow, I met him, and he told me, “I love your song.” This is my... something I can’t forget. He told me... “Bappi? Mr. Bappi, I like your song, “Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Aaja,” and that song “I am a Disco Dancer.”” It is my privilege because Michael Jackson... He is the only powerful singer... Dancer on stage. Because when I shake hands with Michael Jackson, I feel something. Vibration. You understand. Because I am a very religious person. You understand. And when I saw the show in Mumbai... a 60,000 crowd. Oh, my God. But, definite we lost fantastic singer, composer, and everything. Performer. I’m very much shocked.
DJ Rekha
Yeah, it’s a tragedy. Is there anyone who you want to work with... Or wanted to work with... That you cannot work with, and as...
Bappi Lahiri
No, I work with a lot of rappers... Right... MC Hammer... Snoop Dogg. Samantha Fox I brought from London, when Samantha’s hit was very big in London.  “Touch Me. I want to feel you’re body. [laughter]
DJ Rekha
That was the song.
Bappi Lahiri
That time I was... She came to in India... I produced one film called Rock Dancer. And a lot of singer like Boy George, Apache India. Lot of singers. But I want to work with... Definitely my wish...
DJ Rekha
Yes. Wish.

DJ Rekha
She can dance to bhangra, by the way.
Bappi Lahiri
Very much excellent. Excellent actress, also. She’s not a singer.
DJ Rekha

DJ Rekha
You made this for this movie... You and Mithoon. Mithoon is the actor in the movie... And the whole soundtrack is amazing. All of it. You made this for this movie, and then this song spread all over the world. When is the first time you heard this song somewhere else... Not in India? Can you tell me the... Where were you? Do you remember that moment?
Bappi Lahiri
This major... No, this major... I have got every... Again, I have to say, grace of the gods because I have 200 platinum disc in my house. But this picture, Disco Dancer, is such a hit... I have got a China Gold Award. And Chinese version... And Russian version.
DJ Rekha
Yeah, no. No, in both places.
Bappi Lahiri
Now, also, number one.
DJ Rekha
So, where were you? When you... First time you heard, it’s just not India... It’s just not Bollywood. That’s is somewhere else. Do you remember the feeling when you heard about it? 
[speaking Hindi]
Bappi Lahiri
No, definitely. This is the substance of the composition. If my language... They don’t know what is “Jimmy, Jimmy, Aaja, Aaja.”
DJ Rekha
Right.
Bappi Lahiri
But they are singing my song. Like my song, “I am a Disco Dancer.” OK, English what is that? [sings] They don’t know the language. But they are singing. Like other song [sings]. This song is sung by whole Moscow, Uzbekistan, all areas.
DJ Rekha
Yeah, so we if we go from Moscow, and we keep going east... Then we head to China, and then we go north west, and we go around, we have this whole other universe of people growing up and knowing this song. I mean, if you look... If you watch this on YouTube and you see the comments you see people from so many countries saying, “Oh my God, I remember. I remember.” But do you… [speaking Hindi] I’m international. I’m capital B... Bold Bappi Lahiri.
Bappi Lahiri
No, my song is used in Hollywood. So many songs. So many films, you know. But... Like... Lion. The film. Oscar nominated. That song, “Come Closer,” I will sing tonight. Because that song is nominated to Oscar. Film. Not song. Film. But I’m very much proud because my song in the Lion film.
DJ Rekha
No, it’s a great movie.
Bappi Lahiri
And other song is Moana in Indian version.
DJ Rekha
No. No, no, no. Wait. Wait. All right, why don’t we show that. We’ve got that ready. 
[video: Bappi Lahiri – “Shona” from Moana / applause]
That’s great. How did that happen? You were approached... They said, “Can you sing and write?”
Bappi Lahiri
When uh... That Disney told me, “Bappi-da you have to do something in Indian language.” Indian style. That original song was “Shiny.” Shiny! But because I am the always gold, gold man...
DJ Rekha
Perfect casting.
Bappi Lahiri
And they call me, “Bappi, you have to sing this song in Indian style. Indian style, and you have to... Little bit compose your style, and you have to sing like Shona.” Shona! Shona means gold. Anyway, I enjoy. Moana film is outstanding film. Fantastic one. Excellent.
DJ Rekha
And let’s just show the G.O.G... The other clip, too. 
[video: Bappi Lahiri – “Jhoom Jhoom Jhoom Baba” from Guardians of the Galaxy trailer / applause]
That’s the Hindi version of Guardians of the Galaxy. Again, it’s been, your music’s been used a lot in films. How does it feel when someone like M.I.A, you know the Russian version and the Chinese version, but M.I.A sang your song. How did you feel when you heard that version of the song.
Bappi Lahiri
She’s also from Sri Lanka.
DJ Rekha
She’s Sri Lankan, yes, from Sri Lanka.
Bappi Lahiri
Little language, yes. She has used in “Jimmy, Jimmy” version.
DJ Rekha
Yes, and she put some other lyrics in it as well, about genocide.
Bappi Lahiri
But anyway, I love definitely, because we are one, absolutely.
DJ Rekha
So do you…
Bappi Lahiri
My aim is, my life, my music is for everyone, not I’m Hindi or I’m American or Chinese or…
DJ Rekha
So it’s okay if somebody sings your song it feels good to you?
Bappi Lahiri
Everybody’s one. Huh?
DJ Rekha
It feels good to you if she sings a song and then her song version gets to more people, it’s the same thing, because everybody knows it’s your song, right? Yeah?
Bappi Lahiri
I don’t, I always bless them. What for? Because I compose the song. Now, one song came, you know, that very famous 19 years before [sings]. Is Indian language, after 19 years, J-Lo has sang dance floor, and it has been a number one. I inspire, no, no, I inspired this song from Lambada. Because some songs are used so many years back, now also if you put the song it become hit.
DJ Rekha
Let’s see an example of that. So can we play that other clip that you played before? 
[music: Lata Mangeshkar – “Thoda Resham Lagta Hai”]
[music: Truth Hurts – “Addictive” / applause]
So that song. As you can see that’s not Bollywood at all, that’s hip-hop before it was hip-hop. That, of course, was Truth Hurts “Addictive,” produced by DJ Quik on Dr. Dre’s label. Of course the song had a lot of controversy because...
Bappi Lahiri
Not controversy because I tell you, no, because my song, anybody can use but they should give my name that song, because I’m the origin of composer [applause]. I don’t bother whose taking and rapping and hip-hop style anybody, they’re all good people. Very talented. That’s why little controversy is there.
DJ Rekha
No, no, that’s a mild controversy. What do you think about that version? Do you like it? And compared to the original one, so when these people come in…
Bappi Lahiri
Originally have shown this version, is typical Indian style, typical. Most Indian authentic style. That time, practically when… I think so it was 2002, not 2003, no?
DJ Rekha
2000…
Bappi Lahiri
Three. American top chart number three.
DJ Rekha
No it was 2002, because there was this moment in hip-hop, this song happened, Missy Elliott happened, eventually there was a couple of other songs, they started using more Indian samples. It was sort of a moment in hip-hop sort of right around turn of the century and then eventually Punjabi MC happened, etc. But this song was phenomenal…
Bappi Lahiri
Super hit block buster and American top three chart. I’m very happy with the mixing, with the hip-hop with traditional Indian song, like “Kaliyon Ka Chaman” … 
DJ Rekha
But the reason why it works is because the beat is there, the rhythm is there, right? So as it was played.
Bappi Lahiri
Same song, my son Bappa Lahiri, he is also composer. He has remixed this song in India, the number one also.
DJ Rekha
So what happened is this song became popular and then you guys made another version that came out around the same time, and your daughter sang that version, right?
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, yes, yes, very much, she sang.
DJ Rekha
Rema. So your children are also involved in music.
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, and Bappa has totally composed and programming…
DJ Rekha
And a drummer.
Bappi Lahiri
His song is, that song has become super-duper hit in India.
DJ Rekha
Yeah, it’s a great song. If you were not going to be a music composer, or a singer, what would you be doing?
Bappi Lahiri
Oh my God. Anyway, I love... [laughter]
DJ Rekha
Answer the question. I’m not gonna let this one go. 
Bappi Lahiri
No, no, I’m telling you, no no, I love, this is my life, music is my life but apart from this music I love cricket and sports, total sports. I watch all the time sports. When India was the biggest team, like 1960, ’61 India and Australia and India and then like England. From that time I’m seeing the cricket because I was very fond of cricket. My father told me, “You are fond of cricket, you can’t play cricket. Why? Because you are tabla, tabla from the finger and the piano. Don’t go for the cricket, you have to be composer.” So my life is totally cricket and my practical, I am totally mad after cricket. Sports, I love sports. Apart from music that’s all.
DJ Rekha
Well we’re happy that you are not playing cricket. In terms of your other work, as we look at the breadth of your career, there’s the soundtracks, there’s the solo albums, there’s the acting, animation work, but I’m going to play another video, the second to last on the list, to show some of the other stuff you’ve been doing. 
[video: Bappi Lahiri’s Slum Stars – “We Love India” / applause] 
Tell us about this project.
Bappi Lahiri
Oh my God. Thank you. You are appreciating slum boys from Mumbai. First time they have seen the studio. I called them to sing this song. They’re so talented. My life is fulfilled. Totally fulfilled.
DJ Rekha
So this was your idea to make this song?
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, yes, my idea. Behind the idea are the big saint is there, not saint, Mother Theresa. She told me at the Christmas tree, Bappi, in Kolkata, we call a slum, “Bappi you have done so many songs, so many things, but you should encourage the slum boys, they’ve got no chance to sing.” So I fill Mother blessings and I told Mother I’ll definitely do. They have sang so nicely. This is the first part.
DJ Rekha
When was the song, when did you make this?
Bappi Lahiri
This song?
DJ Rekha
Yes.
Bappi Lahiri
Last years back, two years back. I have got the best documentary film I work from Sydney Film Festival, Slum Stars of India. I think so remarkable the singers, you see the full film you will cry. They don’t know how to sing. They came to my house, and I, “Come here, come, come, can you sing?” “I’ve come here for you, I’ll sing for you.” This straight, they have sang and they have started singing, it’s my life, big achievement, this boys, but I want to do something with these slum boys to bring over to America and then everywhere to sing, to perform. I encourage them always.
DJ Rekha
Did you work with any women too or was it just the boys and for this project.
Bappi Lahiri
All boys.
DJ Rekha
No girls?
Bappi Lahiri
No girls.
DJ Rekha
OK. We’ve got to change that.
Bappi Lahiri
But you know that thing is they are so, I can’t tell you. If you can go there, you have seen the film Slum Dog Millionaire right?
DJ Rekha
Of course.
Bappi Lahiri
Everybody has seen, so big hit. But slum stars there become real singers real, they talented.
DJ Rekha
Are you still working with some of the singers?
Bappi Lahiri
Yes, yes, this is the first part.
DJ Rekha
First part so you’re going to continue to work with them.
Bappi Lahiri
All over India, not all over India all over the world, I will take all the slum boys whoever they got that chance to perform on stage. I want to encourage all, all over the world. This is my life time wish.
DJ Rekha
That’s great. We’re going to show one more clip and then we’re going to open the floor for a few questions. In terms of the questions, microphones, because this is being recorded, I’ll ask you to come up and use my mic and speak into the microphone, but let’s show that last clip we had. 
[video: Bappi Lahiri – “Tamma Tamma Hai” / applause]
So, oh... Are we doing... OK. Sure. So... Microphone.  Got a question here.
Audience Member
So first thank you. That was wonderful. It’s a great pleasure to hear all that. When disco first came to your attention [inaudible], what arrived? Was it records and films in ’75, ’76? Were you aware of disco then?
Bappi Lahiri
No. Sorry. I’m telling you 1979 I came first time for the concert in Madison Square and [inaudible] returning here. That time I was in Chicago, one club. The DJ, he’s telling me, “I’m playing the records. We call disco. Disc-co.” Suddenly I feel disco.  What is disco? Beautiful Land yes. Everybody dance. That time is a very famous John Travolta, Saturday Night Fever. Bee Gees. Super duper hit all the songs. And then I thought definitely I should introduce disco in India.  This is that story. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]
Audience Member
You also worked a lot with modern day Indian composers like A.R. Rahman, and Vishal-Shekkhar. Could you tell us something about your experience working with them?
Bappi Lahiri
Very talented. Extraordinarily talented. Both the composers. A.R. Rahman, from the child, like young age, he has played with me. Background music, synthesizers. And he’s extremely talented. Extremely. And Vishal-Shekkhar also. I sang “Ooh La La.” That song becomes super hit. And he has composed so well all the songs. Very balanced composer. You understand balance means all the time, one year, one hit is there. You know Vishal-Shekkhar. And A.R. Rahman, definitely he has done remarkable international composing. “Jai Ho.” And very much, I happy. I’m very happy for A.R. Rahman.
And I sang also A.R. Rahman for composition. [sings]. Song composed by A.R. Rahman. The film becomes super hit. Guru is the Abishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. Both composer is very capable. Thank you.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Audience Member
What was your experience like working with Nazia Hassan? Yeah.
Bappi Lahiri
Good question. Thank you. Nazia. Again when I was talking about Michael Jackson, we lost Michael Jackson. Kishore Kumar, we lost Kishore Kumar. And so young age we lost Nazia Hassan. She has sang so many songs of me. So many. [inaudible]. She sang. “Ilzaam.” “Tonight Pyaar Karo.”  [inaudible]. And when she sang “Disco Deewane,” that time, from that time I know her with her brother Zoheb and Nazia.
Nazia has got very typical voice. You understand. Like modern age voice. Like have you heard the song “Jimmy, Jimmy” sang by Parvati Khan? First I even introduce Parvati Khan. I have introduced so many artists like [inaudible] I have introduced. Usha Uthup. I have introduced. Alisha Chinai I have introduced. All the... Now they are the super pop diva of industry.
But Nazia has got beautiful, sweet voice. I always remember Nazia and very much shocked when she... Very very sad. But she was very good. Excellent. Excellent singer. Thank you.
Audience Member
Thank you.
DJ Rekha
One more?
Audience Member
I thought some of the stuff you were saying about your religious philosophy was really interesting, so I wanted to sorta differentiate. Were you saying that you mean you respect all religions or that you honestly call yourself a religious pluralist and you would identify as Muslim, Christian, Hindu. Does that make sense?
DJ Rekha
[speaking Hindi]
Bappi Lahiri
Respect. I respect all religion. Hundred percent is my, from my heart I am talking. Because I know we are all one. We want peace around the world and this is the thing. We are... Everybody should respect all the religion. My principal, but that’s all. Thank you.
Audience Member

Bappi Lahiri

DJ Rekha
“Divine Power.”
Bappi Lahiri
Please go to the YouTube. iTunes. You’ll love, love the song because the song is very much... You know last today’s everybody’s no peace. You know, tension.

Non-film. Film is coming. Film is very big hit now. My film is coming Ramratan. That is an Indian film. But that is a different story. Ramratan song is very good.
DJ Rekha
Day job.
Bappi Lahiri
Daddy is running, [inaudible] that is different but they’re not [speaking Hindi]. Very big hit. And by the grace of God lot of films are coming. Just now I dubbed Hindi version, like Moana, Kingsman Golden Circle. But Elton John. When they approached me, “Mr. Bappi.” That’s Fox. 
Fox. They’ve approached me in India. “Bappi, can you do full Elton John version in Indian language?” And then, only thing, I respect Elton John. Sad Elton John. He’s a unbelievably fantastic singer. I love sacrifice song. All the time I remember for respect of Elton John I have dubbed and people have loved this version. Because I have tried to... How he has done for guest appearance. I have done like Elton like this.
DJ Rekha
