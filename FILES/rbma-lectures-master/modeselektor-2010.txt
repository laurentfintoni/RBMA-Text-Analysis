Torsten Schmidt 
It is going to be the afternoon breathing session and it is going to be
courtesy of Charlie [aka Sebastian] and Gernot, who are also known to
some of you by the name of
Modeselektor. So please join your
hands and welcome them. [applause]
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Thank you.
Gernot Bronsert 
Thank you.
Torsten Schmidt 
It is kind of good that you got comfy there, because obviously, this is
couples therapy. I do have my notes here and are there any issues that you
want to share with your counselor?
Gernot Bronsert 
Too many to tell.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Let’s start.
Torsten Schmidt 
Where do you start? Speaking of starts, there might be an outbreak of joy in
the next two hours because our dear friend Wulf is actually going into labor — or rather his baby mama — at three this morning, and we somehow made a bet this
morning that the baby is actually going to pop out while we’re sitting here.
If you see us checking the phones now and then…
Gernot Bronsert 
…pop out…
Torsten Schmidt 
That is going to be one giant, that is for sure. So don’t take it as rudeness,
that is the only time mobile phones are allowed here and we might have to get
a song of joy at some stage, so make sure you prepare one in your native
language. But speaking of couples, I never knew how you actually met, you two?
Gernot Bronsert 
At school, primary school.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
In the ‘80s.
Gernot Bronsert 
It‘s true.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
In the dark ‘80s.
Gernot Bronsert 
East Germany, communism. Dusty air, East side.
Torsten Schmidt 
Because there is one thing you have to understand. I mean, you are ‘75 right? You’re ‘78? Well, I was born in ‘74 as well, the year we lost against another nation
in the football World Cup and we still won.
Gernot Bronsert 
Football was forbidden in the GDR.
Torsten Schmidt 
Well, can we therefore erase that game from the records then? 
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes.
Torsten Schmidt 
OK, done, hooray! But what you have to realize is that people our age were actually
raised to hate each other. You see the wall here. Am I sitting... no I am
sitting east, damn. It’s complicated. Obviously, everyone that went to the
East during those days was just coming back with all these stories. What were
the stories that you heard about the other side?
Gernot Bronsert 
They didn’t tell us. You know, I think they are still afraid to talk to us.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I think they were isolated, when they came over. There was no contact.
Gernot Bronsert 
They still hate us.
Torsten Schmidt 
Who is “they” now, just so we get the hate right?
Gernot Bronsert 
I know one story a friend of mine told me, his name is
Rashad. He works for Dubplates & Mastering in Berlin and he came
before the wall came down to Berlin because he just wanted to be different. He
was maybe the only person from the west side who wanted to live on the east side,
and he might know the East German history better than me because I was a
child. I didn’t have an idea anyway about what was happening. It was a crazy
time because everybody was very confused — my parents, the people around us,
the teachers, the bus drivers, the police, everybody was very confused because
everything was new, everything changed. I was just a little boy in the
middle. I didn’t know exactly the day when the wall came down just because I was in
the church to get my piano lessons. I needed to go to church two times a week,
to the guy who is playing the organ in the church. He taught all the kids
piano lessons, and I hated it to go there but I needed to. My parents forced
me since I was six to play piano and I never liked it. That’s why I make techno
now or electronic music. I remember the day when I was there, I needed to
prepare something and I didn’t and I was there and the phone was ringing and
he picked up the phone and he said just, “Yes... Yes... No... Yes.” He hung up
and left the room and never came back. I didn’t know what was going to happen
and I was waiting 20 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour. After one and a half hours
I left. I just thought he went out and was taking a piss, or I don’t know
what, and I went home and my parents told me that the wall has gone and my
piano teacher never came back. I was just happy that I didn’t need to go to
the piano lessons any more, so I was just, “OK, cool. The wall is down and I’m
free now. I don’t need to go to church.”
Torsten Schmidt 
So basically, there was like a very personal freedom that you won that day?
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gorbachev.
Torsten Schmidt 
So what did you actually speculate about, what do you think happened to your
piano teacher?
Gernot Bronsert 
I have no idea. I just asked my parents recently if they know what is going to
happen with this guy, but I think he was just happy. Because all the people who were
involved in Christian movements, they had massive problems with the
communistic government and they just wanted to leave. I think he tried since
ages to leave the country. He was a nice guy… but I hated him.
Torsten Schmidt 
Welcome to life. What was your experience of that?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I was in bed. It was a Thursday, November 9th. Thursday evening and I was in
bed. My mother came to my room and she said, “Sebastian, the wall is down, we
are free.” “Should I go to school tomorrow?” “Yes.” I went to school and 30%
or 40% of the class was missing. That’s my story. One day later, we went to
West Berlin for the first time. We went shopping, records, clothes, Coca-Cola,
turntables.
Torsten Schmidt 
What did you spend your 100
Deutschmarks on?
Gernot Bronsert 
You know what? He is an asshole. When the wall came down the government
decided to give every member from the ex-GDR a welcome present, and this
welcome present were like 100 Deutschmarks. Every bank was packed with East
German people with this little paper in their hands and they were waiting for
their first 100 Deutschmarks. Western money, real money, the good money.
Everybody took his 100 marks and Charlie, he’s an asshole, he found another
100 marks on the ground, so he got 200. So I think he is the only one who
found 100 marks because some idiot lost his first present.
Torsten Schmidt 
It doesn’t sound like much now, 60 quid. But still, how long would your
parents have had to work for that?
Gernot Bronsert 
One-hundred marks? I think, a month? I don’t know, two years. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I think on the black market it was a horrible exchange rate.
Gernot Bronsert 
And he bought a ghetto blaster. I think our generation everyone bought a
ghetto blaster. Everyone went straight to the store and bought a ghetto blaster.
You still have it? You sold it for drugs? Five years later. When he became a
proper member of the Western community you sold it for weed. For Red Bull.
Torsten Schmidt 
Knowing how much ghetto blaster you would get for a 100 Deutschmarks, which is
about everything you could save up for in a summer of paper delivery and
scrubbing the streets and whatever a young kid does to make money, there
wasn’t much of a party if you used that in a party afterwards, right?
Gernot Bronsert 
We didn’t use that to party, we just wanted to have it. Looking at it.
Torsten Schmidt 
And when did you actually master that thought of, “Oh my gosh, it does play
music as well.”
Gernot Bronsert 
The thing is, the only way to discover electronic music was via the radio.
There were a few really nice radio shows in the late ‘80s in West Berlin, so
we were able to listen to the shows, and we recorded a lot of these shows on
tape. I think my mom is calling me. I think I still have some of these shows.
It was the only way to get into electronic music or music in general. You
couldn’t buy any records. For example, Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon, when was it
released? Eight million years ago? In the GDR you just got it 12 million years
later. There was no new music. We still recorded the music from the radio
shows. I still have a few tapes from the old days, like Marusha, Grandmaster Flash.
Torsten Schmidt 
I guess, that is what the then Chancellor Helmut
Kohl called “the mercy of the late
birth.” But for those who don’t know about Marusha, can you give us a little
bit of information about the significance of that person?
Gernot Bronsert 
Does anyone know Marusha? No? One. Two. I am getting old. Marusha was the Mary Anne
Hobbs of Germany for techno.
She didn’t play dubstep at all, in the end it was more like hardcore and Micky
Mouse techno or whatever.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
But in the early ‘90s she had a really good radio show.
Gernot Bronsert 
Called “Rave Satellite” and it was a really important show. Before her was
Monika Dietl.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
She had a very nice voice, a girl from Bavaria, a very erotic voice on the
radio. I had no picture what she looked like.
Gernot Bronsert 
And he was masturbating.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Oh, my god!
Torsten Schmidt 
That is something else people would not understand. Obviously because of the wall and not being able to get over it, a voice from Bavaria is about as exotic as like
a Japanese geisha, right?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Ja.
Gernot Bronsert 
Jaaa. Let’s think about it.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Can I take a picture?
Gernot Bronsert 
Then everything went really fast.
Torsten Schmidt 
Before it goes fast, one thing that is probably really hard to understand, now
you just plug it in and everything that you possibly want is there within
however long that is. The mere fact that you could not only not go to a shop,
but the availability was a totally different thing and a totally different way
of how to discover pop culture, electronic music, however you want to call it.
Gernot Bronsert 
I am too young to describe that. I just got into music after the wall and my
musical socialization was different than to the other kids around the world.
It’s just because I grew up in Berlin, that is my theory, I didn’t grow up
with Nirvana and all this
music. The first track who really touched my heart was Derrick May, a remix of “Sueno
Latino,” I think in ‘91 or ‘92.
And that was the first music that really blew me away. I was just saying, “What is going on? What is it? I don’t know what it is, I don’t get it, it’s too amazing.” Since then I was interested in these black discs and turntables and bass.
Torsten Schmidt 
And where was the place you would go to get these black discs?
Gernot Bronsert 
Hardwax. Hardwax record store. It is the record store in
Germany, or maybe in Europe. UK is not Europe, OK? But I went to the store the
first time, Charlie discovered, he started buying records very early, I
think…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I think it was shortly after the wall came down, we went to West Berlin and we
visited the shop, and they founded it in 1988. They were the first in Berlin. They
imported US records, techno and house records. A very small store, like this room,
with 5,000 records. That’s the story.
Gernot Bronsert 
I went there very early, I don’t remember. Like ‘93 or something, and I asked for jungle. I didn’t
know what that was, it was a new thing and I was just into Underground Resistance before and techno stuff,
the Mover, hardcore stuff. Then
I heard the rumors about this new thing jungle and I went to the store and
I asked for, “Do you have jungle records?” And Pete, he still works there, he said, “Son, I give you jungle records.” He gave me a bunch of records and I
still have them. One of them was an
Aphex [Twin] record and since then I just
brought those records and I played them ‘til death every day. I woke up in
the morning and I played them. Then, I needed to go to school, came back and I
would play them. I was just listening and listening to it again, saved all my
money and went to the store. It took me one and a half hours to get there,
sometimes I had just 10 marks or something, that means one record. I spent
three hours a day to go there and buy one record.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
It was a hard life.
Gernot Bronsert 
It was!
Torsten Schmidt 
Hardwax actually was also great because the guy that took care of the
mailorder, for people who lived far in the West like us…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Do you know the system of the mailorder was somebody called the shop and said,
“OK, do you have this record?” And they played it with the telephone in the
air. No e-mail, fax. And then a monthly paper with all the 12"s and
T-shirts.
Torsten Schmidt 
What I loved most about it, I think Charles was his name? James. The poor guy
had a horrible stutter and they made him do the mailorder.
Gernot Bronsert 
He was British, wasn’t he? He didn’t speak any German. And remember, East German,
a 15 year-old boy calling Hardwax to buy the new Jeff Mills record and then you had James
on the other side. And James was a strange person, he was always talking like
this, “Er, er, er, the new Jeff Mills? 
Torsten Schmidt
That was way too fast. 
Gernot Bronsert 
“Er, er, hold on a second, er, hello?” It
was like this. But it was part of the charm of the whole store. I loved the store.
I still love it.
Torsten Schmidt 
I mean, the great thing with him was also, again, phones were so expensive. We’re
really boring you with stories from the trenches here, but to call Berlin from
somewhere in West Germany for just a minute would cost a fortune, so in the end the
record would cost, I guess, about three times the cost just because the
phone conversation was so long. There was always this excitement when you went
to the mailbox, phone bill or records, what comes first? You had to find out
that there is no use in hiding the phone bill or burning it, or something like that. It all comes back in the end.
Gernot Bronsert 
One day I replaced James. He left and they asked me to work there because I
was there every day and they said, “You should work here.”
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
And after this point everything was getting faster and faster.
Gernot Bronsert 
That was the time when we lived together, we were roommates. They paid good
money but the problem was I hadn’t got any money at the end of the month
because I spent all my money on records. I bought everything. Stupid shit. I
just wanted to have it.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Every evening he was coming back home and he had a big package of records. Twenty,
30.
Torsten Schmidt 
That’s better than food, right? What did you do all day while he was providing
you with records?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Chilling. Unemployed. Sitting by a window drinking coffee, waiting for Gernot.
Gernot Bronsert 
He still does the same. But now I am waiting for him always.
Torsten Schmidt 
Why is that?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know. That is part of my Modeselektor job, waiting for Charlie, at airports, for
example. It is not okay. So, “OK, Charlie, let’s check in now.” “No, wait! I
just want to smoke a cigarette.” “OK, let’s smoke a cigarette.” “I need to buy
a coffee. Where is my money? Can I borrow money? I need to go to a cash
machine.” Always waiting. I think he lives longer because he is very slow. And I
am so fast, so we are totally different. As you recognize already I am the
talking guy, he is more the…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
…the listening guy.
Torsten Schmidt 
So how do you ever get anything done then?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know. That is the other difference we have, he is synaesthetic. He can remember
everything. Like when he said, “…it was on a Tuesday,” then it was Tuesday,
I’m sure we can check on the Internet, it was a Tuesday. He remembers the
shittiest, smallest things but he forgot to bring the music this morning.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Really, I remember things which are ten years ago.
Gernot Bronsert 
But when you ask him what time it is, he says, “It’s three, three o’clock
now.” And you wait ten seconds, “What time is it?” And he must look again to see what time it is.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
That is my problem.
Gernot Bronsert 
He is handicapped.
Torsten Schmidt 
Which brings us back to couples therapy, I guess. I will be the shrink. So how
does that make you feel?
Gernot Bronsert 
First, you should tell the story you told us this morning for everybody.
Torsten Schmidt 
Which one, exactly?
Gernot Bronsert 
The one you mother likes to tell.
Torsten Schmidt 
That one. That’s a absolutely lovely one. But we’ll do that later. So how does it make
you feel when you have to wait for Charlie?
Gernot Bronsert 
It is a process. When you ask me how I felt two years ago, I needed to learn
to handle that problem. Last year I bought a book. It was a sketchbook, and
the sketchbook was there to write down every minute I am waiting for him. After two weeks it was full.
Torsten Schmidt 
Who of my colleagues actually prescribed that? 
Gernot Bronsert 
Was? [speaking German] He is like Charlie.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
But I remember that sketchbook was a gift from me to him. It was yellow.
Gernot Bronsert 
I think after the year I was waiting two days, I’d just write down 30 minutes
on Tuesday, 15 minutes Wednesday, and so on, and I think it was in total two days waiting for Charlie.
Torsten Schmidt 
That is not bad, come on. There are 365 days in a year.
Gernot Bronsert 
When you are on tour you need to wait for other things as well, you need to
wait for planes, drivers, sound check…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
That is addition. In the end you have 150 days for waiting.
Gernot Bronsert 
I would say two weeks.
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s like being a supermodel.
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes, that’s nice.
Torsten Schmidt 
Just try and think of it that way.
Gernot Bronsert 
I like that idea. Geisha.
Torsten Schmidt 
Now what would your wife say about that? About you being supermodels?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know. I don’t know.
Torsten Schmidt 
Obviously, you both do lead a family life. Now with all that waiting, how do you run a
family? Especially when you’re on tour all the time?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know. Now we have a tour manager and she is taking care of us. She has
been doing our booking since the beginning, and after a while we have fucked so
many things up. We lose flights, took the wrong trains, then the
booking agency decided to hire a babysitter for us, and since then we have a
tight schedule. Having a family, a little baby, or now a kid at home, it’s not easy
when you are on tour. And it means to me, that we pay the biggest bill. That
means that we don’t sleep that much, so we take always the last plane we
can get to the gig and take the first plane back home. That means we
arrive very late and then we leave very early. That means totally wasted to the
airport, no sleep sometimes. I remember one time we played at a festival in
France together with T. Raumschmiere, and we drank a lot. We went
together with him to the airport and the ground staff didn’t want to let us in
because we were smelling so much and we said, “No, we’re not drunk any more,
we stopped drinking two hours ago.” And T. Raumschmiere was just wearing
sunglasses like this, with his passport, and they didn’t want to let us in.
And that is because we took the first plane. And T. Raumschmiere has a little
baby, two little babies at home, and he is doing the same thing. Latest plane,
first plane.
Torsten Schmidt 
Are there actual kindergartens and primary schools in Berlin for techno
producers?
Gernot Bronsert 
It’s a good idea.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We should do that. Opens very late. Two, four until one. Skpping Monday.
Gernot Bronsert 
Little Ricardo is coming, hello! Little Modeselektor, hello!
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Black painted walls.
Gernot Bronsert 
Strobe light. Little small customized Funktion One system. Our kids, they grow up with our music, with beats.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
They really love beats, bass drums.
Gernot Bronsert 
Bass drums, they love bass drums.
Torsten Schmidt 
Does that make the whole production process easier?
Gernot Bronsert 
Which process? Producing babies or…?
Torsten Schmidt 
That is kind of hard I hear, yeah.
Gernot Bronsert 
They changed our rhythm totally. We used to work by night, always, so we would
just wake up at four usually. We started drinking at six and then we went at eight
to the studio, and we got out of the studio at seven in the morning, and since
the last two records we are not able to do that anymore. We have a studio day
job.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Like normal boring workers. We go to work at ten, we get a coffee, lunch break…
Torsten Schmidt 
It is almost like an old socialist ideal, every artist works in the same way
as everyone in the factory. Do you find your health has improved?
Gernot Bronsert 
I am tired. I’m just tired always. I feel always like jetlagged. I hope it
stops soon. Maybe in ten years. I feel always pretty tired, just because I
never get enough sleep. Never. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Too much traveling.
Gernot Bronsert 
Too much children. Waiting for Charlie.
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s getting really sad here, and on this note maybe we should go back to
the production process, but maybe we will leave the babies aside for a second
and talk about the music. What is it that you set up over there, is this only
for live circumstances? Would you use something similar when you are in the
studio?
Gernot Bronsert 
No, this is just a live set. And that is a surprise today because he forgot
the records. We wanted to play some of our music and records, black discs, you
know them? That is why we wanted to bring them, you know? Yeah, we forgot them at home this morning, then we asked for a cab driver who was bringing the records from my
house, but it was already too late so I sent him back halfway. He was already
almost at the airport, but I needed to check in so I called him and told him to go back, we need to check in. We didn’t have
any records and then we had a great idea, let’s buy all our records on iTunes
and play them, but because we don’t have records on the computer and we have
all the live tracks, we can play the tracks live. We need to perform them live. That’s no fake, that’s true.
Torsten Schmidt 
Shall we get into it straight away and leave a bit of the talk for a minute?
Gernot Bronsert 
What should we play?
Torsten Schmidt 
Are you taking requests like a wedding DJ?
Gernot Bronsert 
OK, the first request. Let’s make it easier. One for girls or one for boys? Girls? Shit. OK, for girls. Which one?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I have an option but I think it is too early?
Gernot Bronsert 
I think we will play one of the tracks we did with our friend
Apparat together from the Moderat project. We can also play it
with the visuals, maybe that is a good idea and then after we play some stuff.
Do it like this? OK, can we turn the lights down? We want to see the
projection. So this was actually the first track we did for the Moderat
project, it is called “A New Error.” OK. Can you see it? Just have a look.
(video: Moderat – “A New Error” / applause)
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Thank you.
Gernot Bronsert 
This is the project we have with Sascha
Ring, the artist name is
Apparat and this is Moderat. The idea of this project is an audiovisual idea.
Charlie and me as Modeselektor, we work with an artist collective from
Berlin since the beginning called de Pfadfinderei. They are a pretty
famous VJ crew and agency and they are in charge of our artwork and our
corporate identity, whatever you want to call it, and they come with us on the
live shows usually. When we decided to make this Moderat thing happen, we just
added them to the bill and made an audiovisual record, and this was one of the
tracks with a clip made by them.
Torsten Schmidt 
But if they are that much of a big part of the whole show, why is it not Moderat and
Pfadfinderei in the end?
Gernot Bronsert 
That is always the question the Pfadfinderei are asking me. We put the emphasis on the
music first and the Moderat project was already existing since…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
…2003.
Gernot Bronsert 
When, exactly? What day?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
It was 2002 during the soccer championship in Japan. Then we played with Apparat
some shows, some synchronized shows with our very amazing equipment, three laptops,
three boys. Then we tried to find a name. Then we found it. 
Gernot Bronsert 
The first thing that was existing was Moderat and that was one of the main
reasons we continued. We really liked the name. Apparat, Modeselektor,
Moderat.
Torsten Schmidt 
But to some extent what is great about the project is that it somehow rather
accentuates things that are interesting in your separate work. It is almost
like it brings it out a little more. It is almost like euphoric music for
manic-depressive people.
Gernot Bronsert 
You think so? It is not manic-depressive, it is more the mood we like when we
are in Berlin. Berlin is pretty depressive when you live there, when you grow
up there. Now it’s full of people from all over the world who are so
excited always, but they are there usually for one or two years and then they leave.
We grew up there and we saw the big changes and we still see the big changes.
It’s not a nice town, it’s not beautiful, not at all, I mean it got destroyed 90% in the World War. This record, it’s a little homage to this town, because we wanted to show the world that Berlin is not minimal techno and
having a party for three days. That is not the reality. Since the wall it is a
rave town. It is all about techno and electronic music.
Torsten Schmidt 
What do you reckon is the percentage of people who actually grew up in Berlin
and are actively doing music, not everybody in Berlin who claims to be a DJ,
but is actively doing something and getting gigs with more than 20 people?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know.
Torsten Schmidt 
Any ideas? How many people that you went to school with ended up in music?
Gernot Bronsert 
None really, just me and Charlie. One of the funny things is that normal
people now, they have families like us but we are not normal. They have a house and garage, two
cars, all that shit, but they know Jeff Mills. That’s maybe some of the effects from Berlin.
Torsten Schmidt 
As a visitor it almost seems a bit like New York in the 19th century condensed
in five or ten years. You always have these waves, and in the same way that you
have the Irish there and the Italians and the Germans and the Polish coming
into New York, it’s like, “OK, first of all everyone from
Schwaben comes there, then all the
other counties of West Germany, then...”
Gernot Bronsert 
Then New York. In 2003, 2004, it was full of New York guys. That is where we
met all of our friends from New York. They are all back in New York, they just
spent two or three years. Fantastic
nobodies. We have a few friends we met
in Berlin that are from New York.
Torsten Schmidt 
Then all the Latin Americans and Spanish came.
Gernot Bronsert 
Yeah but they come just for the weekend. We call them EasyJet ravers. They arrive on
Friday, then they go straight to Berghain and they leave on Monday morning
almost dead. That’s why we have so many wheelchairs at the airport. On
Mondays. Some of them cannot walk any more. It’s over.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
It’s so sad.
Gernot Bronsert 
I think I was 14 or something, 15 years old, I went every Wednesday to
Tresor club, which has closed now. It
is open but it is different, a different location, it is not run by the same
people. I went there every Wednesday because the entrance was just five marks
and I was able to afford it.
Torsten Schmidt 
Who was playing Tresor on Wednesdays?
Gernot Bronsert 
It was called Headquarters, new faces and residents. From time to time you had
the luck to see Mad Mike with a hockey
mask and Jeff Mills on a 909 and Rob Hood playing and I didn’t know what
was going on. Mad Mike was rapping. Underground Resistance with a hockey mask
and Rob Hood with a 909 and Jeff Mills and I was like, “Oh. What’s that?” And it
was on a Wednesday and the next day I went to school. “How was it yesterday?”
“It was nice.” Things like this are not possible any more.
Torsten Schmidt 
Were you still part of the same school? You were years apart, but you were in
the same school?
Gernot Bronsert 
I was a little shitty guy and he was the big dog.
Torsten Schmidt 
Did you have any other rave buddies from school?
Gernot Bronsert 
I have one who lives in New York now. He used to live in London so he
followed the music when he lived in London. Now he lives in New York and he is
still on the ball, he knows everything. “Hey, have you checked out this new UK
funky guy. Do you like UK funky? Hey, do you know this aqua-step guy from West
Brighton? Ah yeah, yeah.” I don’t know. What’s that music called from Argentina?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Cumbia. You have ten
different styles of cumbia. That electronic part. It’s like a tree, you have the cumbia tree. Gangster, high speed.
Gernot Bronsert 
Country, ambient tree. Whatever.
Torsten Schmidt 
Why did you to stop working in the record shop then?
Gernot Bronsert 
My problem was I had Monday. That was one of the main reasons I had to stop,
because we started playing at weekends and then the Monday was a bad day when
you play Friday, Saturday, Sunday, a typical Sunday thing.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Was somebody there on Monday? Customers?
Gernot Bronsert 
Yeah, yeah. I couldn’t change the date, and then it was time to say goodbye and
Marcel Dettmann replaced me so I needed to work him in. Marcel came after me and he got the Monday and I said, “Heh.” [raises middle finger]
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
And now you’ve got a Tuesday?
Gernot Bronsert 
He is not in the store anymore, he is in the distribution, and he is ordering
the techno stuff, Euro stuff and US, so he is in charge.
Torsten Schmidt 
Is there anyone working there that did not go on to make records?
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes. Michael. He is one of the very, very long members. He is the only
friendly guy in the store. You will recognize him because he has glasses. They
are all friendly but you need your time to break the barriers. Every new face
they check, so when you go to Hardwax and you ask if they have some pumping stuff, then you can go. Just turn around and go. They will never serve you
properly. You need to read a book about Detroit and dubstep before and then go
and you need to drop some skills, you need to show you know what is going on.
Torsten Schmidt 
So what are the ten best things stop a dubstep or Detroit techno imposter?
Someone who’s just read the book but not know what they’re talking about?
There must be a very delicate Hardwax way of finding out, “Do you know or are
you just pretending?”
Gernot Bronsert 
No. I think the Hardwax communication is a very special way of communication.
It depends on who’s working. I had a few situations. So I think they asked me to
work in the store to bring some freshness again. Because you had, for example,
Pete, a.k.a. Substance], he is
working there since a long, long time and he specialized in one very special
type of music. Then you have other artists like René, who is
Vainqueur. I don’t know if you know
this. Everyone who was working there specialized in one thing. You have Marcel
for the techno stuff,
Sleeparchive is working at
Hardwax as well at the moment, it is a family thing. That is pretty weird.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
And you have Manel. Ask for Manel, next time you go to Berlin.
Gernot Bronsert 
We forced him three years to make a record. We want to make a label for Manel,
Manel 001, we are waiting for the record.
Torsten Schmidt 
Obviously, when you are in the store at least once a week, it’s relatively easy to keep
up with what’s going on. How do you manage that? Because you seem to be relatively
well-informed on what is going on.
Gernot Bronsert 
There are two different sides. You have the internet thing. I get a lot of
postings every day and links to new stuff.
Torsten Schmidt 
Of which you listen to how many percent?
Gernot Bronsert 
I try to check everything. When I get the new Powerhouse promo from DJ Nobody then I don’t listen to it, but now I have a well-working system from people all
over the world. Jake is one of them, he sends me for the third time the same
link. “Hey! New record, totally amazing!” I know it. At Hardwax we have our own
little folder, where they are putting stuff we like. So I have one guy at the
store who totally knows what I like and what I am interested in, he’s putting
promos and all that stuff and I go once a week there and take my records and
check them.
Torsten Schmidt 
Do you find that old-school system of someone in the store actually deciding
that’s something he could like, that’s something he could like and putting
them aside works better than these algorithms on Web stores where they go,
like, “If you bought this then you might want that”?
Gernot Bronsert 
Of course. Because it’s a different way to bring people into music. The personal
thing is very important because after a while you have a relationship. I can just talk for myself, but...
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
The feeling when you go in the store and you have a real person with a real
record who is showing you, OK that is a record and there is a story behind, linking to another project and you play it on a system, a very good system in a
record store — that’s the best promotion you can have to buy a record. For
example, when you go on the internet...
Gernot Bronsert 
On the internet it is different...
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Every file is short. Bad quality. And it’s not a feeling.
Gernot Bronsert 
I really like the idea to have a label which doesn’t want to have any
promotion, doesn’t want to have digital sales, just a stamp, white label, doing
it for fun, for the music. Sometimes you have a record which has success. For
example, last year there was a record from Hardwax, Equalized 03, and it was one of
the guys working there and he wants to be an anonymous.
Torsten Schmidt 
Which one was it again?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
It’s not Manel.
Gernot Bronsert 
[laughs] It’s not Manel. And this record had a really amazing success. Like the Sleeparchive phenomena, the
person behind Sleeparchive is producing music since ages, but he did totally
different stuff under different names, so I think they have different
pseudonyms, three or four names sometimes. But we are totally different. We
are kind of the ambassadors between the realities. We are there and on the
Friday we play in Spain with Richie Hawtin, and on the Saturday we
play on a dubstep party in Kenya, and on Sunday and we play in Scotland, a UK
funky garage house ambient country party. We are everywhere. First, it is fun to
discover everything and see what is going to happen. We really like pop and
bands. I would die for Blonde Redhead. When we play in the summer, the festivals, and I see Blonde Redhead is playing, then I
force the crew to stay two hours longer so that I can see them. They are
waiting on a bus totally pissed.
Torsten Schmidt 
Finally you get your revenge and Charlie is waiting for you.
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes. So it’s a good thing to be interested in everything but it has a bad
side on the same moment because you have so much input the whole time. You
have inputs from everywhere.
Torsten Schmidt 
But I mean having too much input is probably the curse of our times, and that is
something we all have to deal with every single day, making decisions on what
we focus on. If you are open enough to be just tickled and interested in so
many different things…
Gernot Bronsert 
Yes, but it’s a question of discipline, you know?
Torsten Schmidt 
Natürlich!
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t have discipline. For example, I get addicted very fast and very quick
from several things. For example, I have a new app for my iPhone, a game or
something, or a little synthesizer, and I’m non-stop playing with that. I don’t
get bored of it, I get addicted. I need to delete this app to stop it. I just
recently gave all my passwords for all accounts from MySpace, Twitter,
Facebook to someone who is taking care of it now because I just realized that
I never read a book for months. I didn’t read a book in three months or
something and I just wasted too much time on the internet. That scared me a
little bit. I think everyone has this problem but I need to make cuts.
Torsten Schmidt 
That is obviously a bit of life advice there that if you go back to the
studio and the production side of it, it is really like how do you actually
come up with a record that sounds like me or us in your case?
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t know. The thing is, when you asked me how I make the Moderat record, I
don’t remember. I remember situations when, for example, Charlie was
sleeping behind Sasha and me for hours and we were thinking about painting his
face black or something. But I don’t remember how I made this melody. It’s
like being on a rush. I just need the situation to get into. I need to get into a flow,
it doesn’t matter what I use. In the studio we use everything. We use software, we use
hardware, we use toys. I don’t know, microphones, instruments, everything. Sometimes
we create some sounds or melodies or beats and then we forget to record that
or to save the preset or whatever. There is one funny story. We set up one of
our studio rooms two years ago with analog equipment, so we have a lot of
analog equipment which is just lying in a corner and getting dusty. But this
time we said, “OK, now we make a proper MIDI studio like in the old days,” and
everything is fine and then it took us three days to set up the equipment. We were
thinking about, should we bring the Atari back? We really want to make it old-school. Then it was running and we made sessions and there was one session which was amazing.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We switched the lights off to see the LEDs. It was like an airport, to see the runway, everything was red.
Gernot Bronsert 
We were both wearing UR T-shirts and then we made it a session and we recorded
the session and we switched it off and after two weeks we wanted to listen to
the recording and Sebastian? We recorded it…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
…but with the microphone in the room and the phone was ringing in the middle
and there was no quality at all and we were just thinking, “OK, I was
barfing...”
Gernot Bronsert 
He is the best barfer in the world, by the way.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We still have it and it is a nice session. We tried to recreate it but it
wasn’t possible.
Torsten Schmidt 
Win some, lose some. OK, so obviously, you can’t always recreate that when you go
live, but nevertheless you have to deal with all these punters that come there, pay good money to come and see you and they have certain expectations. How do you make sure you can give them the
experience that they want?
Gernot Bronsert 
As I told you, the live thing and the studio thing are totally different
worlds. You cannot bring them together. When we are in the studio, we don’t
want to have people around us, so it’s like being naked. I don’t feel good. For
example, we have a friend from Japan and he’s a really nice guy. We have a
really nice friendship with him and he’s interested in electronic music and gear,
and it was just a couple of years ago, and he came to our studio every day and he
thought he was doing us a favor to show his respect. I was getting more and more into, I was feeling like
Big Brother because
I was sitting there and then, is he still there? I can’t do it now…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
He’s behind you…
Gernot Bronsert 
I don’t like this, having people around us. For example, we change rooms
often. We used to have a caravan with a studio inside. It sounds pretty pimp
but it was shit. It was smelling inside like a dead cat or something. It was
not nice inside, but the sound was good and we just wanted to have the situation that
you can go everywhere you want and make music, record music and have fun.
Torsten Schmidt 
How many times did you actually really use it, honest?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
A half time.
Gernot Bronsert 
The problem is when you are in a caravan and you say, “OK, let’s go to a lake
and make a track,” then you don’t make music, you end up on the lake. It was
fun. It was an idea we had. We wanted to record the full-length record in this
caravan, but no.
Torsten Schmidt 
But you had a nice sunburn. Now, when you say it is really personal when you are in the studio and you
can’t really deal with any visitors, and it is hard enough that you are two
already, so there is someone outside of your own brain and emotions there
while you are trying to come up with the idea.
Gernot Bronsert 
We are one person in the studio, it is crazy, we don’t need to talk. We’re an
old couple. He is the technique geek and he’s to explain to me always all
these things. I have sometimes no idea what is going on with the computer and
then Charlies comes in and says, “Son, let me explain.” I say, “OK, now I got it, because of this…” He got me into music production a long, long
time ago, long time. He had a little studio at home and I came one day to him
and he had this E-MU sampler, an EMX-1, an Atari
and the Space Echo and I came
just by coincidence to him. I think I wanted to buy some weed, I don’t
remember. [laughs]
Torsten Schmidt 
That is something every Berlin musician needs to drop. Is that how you got the
money for the Space Echo?
Gernot Bronsert 
I’m just kidding, he never smoked. He tried sometimes, PCP or stuff like this. [laughter] Anyway, I came into his room and he had a loop running.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Sending it through the Space Echo.
Gernot Bronsert 
And there was one button, the mode selector button, and I think we spent four or five hours with one loop playing with the button
going [mimes playing live] and since then we are a band called Modeselektor,
that is a story by the way. Should we play a track? Which one? Let’s play
“Sucker Pin.” 
(music: Modeselektor – “Sucker Pin” / live performance)
(music: Modeselektor – unknown / live performance)
Torsten Schmidt 
As far as live techniques go, laptop posing, a very difficult, right?
Gernot Bronsert 
We’re so busy always, I think we don’t look like we’re checking emails.
Torsten Schmidt 
That’s the main concern, right?
Gernot Bronsert 
Yeah, I know. But I don’t care.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
When we started as Modeselektor we played with real electronic instruments, with
drum machines. We played only in Germany and Berlin shows. We did a little
Berlin tour, because it was impossible to carry all that stuff. One time we
played in Berlin, you have a little island on the river
Spree, there’s a club, it’s called Insel der Jugend, the Island of Youth, and we put all the gear on a stand over the bridge to the island. 
Torsten Schmidt 
The glamorous life of being a techno live act. [goes into the audience to figure out where a noise is coming from] So, about the whole being live,
how much of that is actually planned? Especially, with the Moderat shows, I mean, most
of the tracks stop when Carl Craig would start introducing the bassline. 
Gernot Bronsert 
You are talking about Moderat? 
Torsten Schmidt 
You know there’s the build-up, the build-up, the build-up and then, Oh! What happened?
Gernot Bronsert 
That’s the way, that is the Moderat way. There is a very nice term for it. I
will remember later. When we play as Modeselektor then there is not really a
big plan behind. So we talk about which tracks we want to play and in which
order, but we change it anyway. When we play with Moderat we need to follow
the track-listing because we have a pretty massive visual set-up going on onstage and the VJ who is playing the Moderat clips live. It’s like playing in a
band, but we don’t have a bass player, we have a VJ and then we need to hold eye
contact on special songs, like, “OK… now!” There is one song called “Les Grand Marches” with Moderat, and there is a
concrete block in the middle, which is exploding in one special moment and he
needs to play it live. And they are always so nervous because of this song,
they’re just like this [mimes intense stare]. They are not musicians, they
are so into their visual thing and I told them always, “You just need to
count, just count the fucking song!” Maybe we can have a look at it?
Torsten Schmidt 
Maybe, while it is warming up, you want to take a question?
Audience Member
So my question is, I saw that you were choosing tracks on the live PA, I wanted to know when you are performing you have to continuously play songs, right? So how do you go from one track to another?
Gernot Bronsert 
What you saw is one song. So bassline, beat, vocals, hi-hats, snares, cymbal, and you
can save this up as a preset, so when you play the next song you go to the
next preset, push the button, pop. We customize this patch to play under every
circumstance you can imagine – rain, snow, drunken, without sleep, sleeping,
dead, everything. This patch Jihad Live is made from the people who use it. We
use it non-stop so, for example, when we buy a new MIDI controller we change
the whole patch for the MIDI controller. I buy a MIDI controller for just one
or two buttons. So I have more things to play. It is pretty intense to get
into this Max/MSP thing but Sasha, Apparat, is helping us a lot with that. For
example, Robert Henke, Monolake, he
is helping from time to time. We can change little things. But when I want to
change global things I need to call Professor Henke, Monolake. He is a professor
at the moment, at a university in Berlin. He replaced one of the Kraftwerk guys who was teaching there. Anyway.
Torsten Schmidt 
When you go and buy MIDI controllers doesn’t it feel like, compared to buying a
synth, isn’t it a bit like going to buy condoms or something?
Gernot Bronsert 
For example, we use these blue things, they are not available in the stores
any more, so I need to buy them on eBay because I really like the handling of
this controller. I think this is number eight already and the last one I
bought in the US so it took four or five weeks to get one. Then we sometimes use
this KORG thing and it’s too heavy, like seven kilo. Our Modeselektor rule is hand
luggage. I cannot wait on the belt for my luggage, I just need my luggage
straight. As I told you, I’m just tired of waiting. And anyway, when you play
a lot and tour a lot on aeroplanes then it is better to have everything.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
The hand luggage rule is only for Modeselektor, for Moderat we had 19 cases.
Four hundred kilograms. We paid extra luggage every time on every airline in the world.
Torsten Schmidt 
Wouldn’t it make sense in that case to have an airline sponsoring you?
Gernot Bronsert 
They don’t sponsor. Just soccer teams or championships. We are little
piece of shit for them. Lufthansa, hello. There is just one airline I want to
have as my sponsor and this is Lufthansa. Not British Airways.
Audience Member 
So when you guys are performing live, as you were doing just then, and you
have sections when you are building up to a big drop and you take the bass out
for a while, and you bring in the drums or whatever else you’re doing, do you
guys have a set regiment sort of thing, or do you just feel it and go for it as
you please?
Gernot Bronsert 
Just feel it. Sometimes we see it makes no sense to make a big rave deal here.
For example, we can play totally quiet. We can play a quiet set if you want to, or a totally J Dilla-esque set, or a trance set, in fact. We can do everything, you know? Mostly, we play all the genres in one
set so we have different parts always. Usually, we think in tempi, so we have
blocks, 100 BPM is the hip-hop block so we know we have a few tracks on 100
BPM. Then we have 140, my favorite…
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
…and we can change the tracklists in the next ten seconds or five seconds.
Gernot Bronsert 
Sometimes, we have a super friendly DJ before the show and he is playing two
or three Modeselektor tracks and you need to switch anyway and change your
set. It is all about feeling. Sometimes, we are totally tired and the show is amazing
and sometimes we are totally into it and it is medium. It’s random. There is no
concept, it’s not Chemical Brothers.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Which is not easy for the video guys.
Gernot Bronsert 
They have the hardest job by the way, because they don’t know what’s going
on, they need to change everything.
Torsten Schmidt 
So you’re having these intercom things like on the Tour de France?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We Twitter it. We tweet it. Next song?
Torsten Schmidt 
There’s another question over there.
Audience Member
I have got a question about the sound because I think you have a very
typically Modeselektor sound. Every track, every production when you hear it,
it must be Modeseleckor and nothing else because I think every part or every
track, it sounds very thick and punchy and it sounds like you didn’t use very many
tracks. One track, very minimalistic from the construction, but very punchy. Everything is very... I just wanted to ask about the equipment you use.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
I will show you, there is a secret. That’s the secret.
Gernot Bronsert 
We don’t use soundcards. We recorded Thom
Yorke with that so you don’t need
soundcards. You don’t need big equipment. We have not really a nice monitor
situation at all. We just work a long time and test the tracks on sound systems. The good thing is when you tour, you can test your sketches and then you know exactly, “Oh, that’s too much bass.”
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Another thing is also to take the computer in the car, we have a mini jack
adapter, put it in the radio. That is the best listening you can have.
Gernot Bronsert 
We are checking the tracks on a lot of things, his old ghetto blaster with his
first 100 Deutschmarks. 
Audience Member
I just thought you have one regular way to do this. 
Gernot Bronsert 
No, we change speakers always. We worked a long time with Atom speakers, then we
switched to Mackie, then we switched to Genelec, now we are working with Genelec. In the end it’s just a speaker. We don’t care.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
The first speakers we used for the first records in 2000, 2001.
Gernot Bronsert 
He found them on the street. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Old JBL speakers for a hi-fi. They looked like ’80s...
Gernot Bronsert 
They were white, but they were yellow. They looked pretty fucked up. Yeah, but in the
end, there are just a few things you should take care. When you buy speakers, just read a little bit about how and where is the best situation and in the end
don’t spend too much time with the perfect situation to listen to music or to produce music. A friend of mine, Mark Ernestus, he owns Hardwax record store and makes music as well,
he spent two years building up his studio and it’s absolutely over on the
next level what this guy is doing. But I don’t need that. It’s really nice to
go into a studio like this and to have a mixdown, or master your stuff, or
listen to your stuff and have a reference. But I think we will never have a
studio like this, never. 
Gernot Bronsert 
Which is okay.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
It’s okay.
Audience Member
I just wanted to ask, you were saying it is like a rule not having a soundcard? Is it for any particular reason?
Gernot Bronsert 
No. We bought sometimes soundcards and we checked them out and we tried to work
with them but in the end, no. We just don’t use them. If we want to have a
proper studio, we go to Apparat and his studio. He has a nice studio mixing
desk, same speakers. [looking at speakers in the room]
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
These are really cool. 
Gernot Bronsert 
But they are lying to you. They sound too good.
Audience member
Don’t you ever get any latency on the MIDI control?
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We have a little offset regulation somewhere with the time sync.
Gernot Bronsert 
I have a little delay because I’m a little faster than him. When we play live.
Audience Member
Hi, I’m Adam from San Francisco. 
Gernot Bronsert 
Hey Adam, what’s up? 
Audience Member
How are you doing? What’s happenin’?
Gernot Bronsert 
Hyphy! 
Audience Member
Uh, yeah...
Gernot Bronsert 
Where are your stunna shades? 
Audience Member
That was five years ago, man.
Gernot Bronsert 
I know. [laughs]
Audience Member
I was wondering, how do you guys control the mix of the different instruments?
Obviously, you have the mixer there but to know what the bounce is going to be
between the kick and the bass and all the different elements. Is somebody else
mixing the actual things?
Gernot Bronsert 
We prepare the presets in the studio and then we check them on the soundsystems and after every soundcheck, I make new presets. For example, I have some presets which is two years old and I never touch it because I know it’s sounding perfect. And I have presets which I know, “OK, on this
soundsystem, it is better to make the hi-hat louder.”
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
That is what we do during the soundcheck. Listen to every track to find a new
balance.
Gernot Bronsert 
…to check it for the soundsystem so it works on the soundsystem. Which is not always possible, say,
at a festival where we don’t have a soundcheck. But usually, at a festival
there is a nice soundsystem.
Audience Member 
Little question about your sound. Sometimes, it’s easy to forget that you
guys are from Berlin. I think you have more in common with London sound in a
way. A lot of vocals, multi-genre, a lot of big drops. When I think of Berlin
I think of longer sets that run on. What’s your thought about that? Is your
sound a backlash to that? Do you like that, are you not too into it?
Gernot Bronsert 
That is what I wanted to try to explain when I talked about the Moderat
record. You cannot say the sound of Berlin is like this, you know? We are influenced by British rave music since the beginning. Dubstep is rave. Even Digital Mystikz, it’s rave because there is one idea behind it.
Torsten Schmidt 
Who, by the way, are some of your biggest fans, actually.
Gernot Bronsert 
Mala? Cool! I mean, we DJ and we’re
friends and the last time that somebody blew me away with minimal music… in
the end it’s minimal music. It’s not much, it’s dub, and dub is minimal. Very minimal.
Not the genre, I don’t like to think in genres. Genres are so old-fashioned. It makes not really sense in the end, it’s about the tune. If a track on
M-nus, Richie Hawtin’s label, is good, then it
is about the track and not about the cube or the black
dress, it’s about the tune. If you have a trance track, which is good, then
the track is good, you can’t change it. It is not here, it is in your ass and
in your heart.
Audience Member
I don’t really mean the track itself, I just more mean your entire set. You are not
the sort of guys to do a six-hour, slow build-up kind of set.
Gernot Bronsert 
I am tired of it, because I grew up with that. That was the music, that was my first
music experience and I had that long enough so I don’t need that anymore.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
And when we talk about a short set, like Moderat is a short set, we want to
show a set like a movie. A movie is about one hour and one hour and a half
with no encore, no extras in the end. That was the plan from Moderat, and that is
the reason the set is kind of short, but it is intense.
Gernot Bronsert 
And it is the difference between DJ and live. I cannot imagine to play a song
which is 12 minutes long. What should I do on stage? What should I do?
Waiting. Eight bars, 16 bars, hi-hats, effect. Eight bars, 16 bars, snare. Long break, C-part, end,
next track. Then you play one track for five hours over. I grew up with that. I
can’t do it. For example, when I’m listening to, say, a Digital Mystikz track, OK,
Mala, six minutes long, I could never make a track like this, because it’s deep. I just bought an
acid record from DJ Sneak yesterday, acid
tracks, an old one from ‘94, eight minutes long. It’s great to listen to and great to
dance to, but I could never do this.
Audience Member
Do you feel closer to the UK scene in that sense than the Berlin one?
Torsten Schmidt 
You really want to claim him, don’t you?
Audience member
It’s just interesting to me because the kind of sound that you are doing is
all around me all the time.
Gernot Bronsert 
Why not? 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We are feeling very close to you.
Torsten Schmidt 
Speaking of which, is there any place on earth where you’re bigger than Glasgow?
Gernot Bronsert 
Maybe Berlin, but I think, no. It is the same level, I think. I have no idea.
Last time we played there was Moderat and then I went with Jackmaster to the afterparty. He was playing there with Untold and in the end they needed to protect me because I think everybody in this club wanted to take a picture with me. I needed to sign everything, like arms, faces, hand. Cell phones. I don’t know why it happened. I think these guys were the first
guys who booked us in the UK. They were the day before in London at Plastic
People, but it was with
Martin from Rubadub, so the Glasgow connection. Then we
played with Numbers and since then we have played one or
two times a year with them. This year, we stopped playing Modeselektor, so we
have a break now and we continue touring with Moderat in the summer. And Jack
forced us to play Numbers so he is the exception this year that we play, and
tonight. Usually, we wanted to DJ tonight but I couldn’t find my record bag.
I’m not kidding, it’s true. So we play live tonight, Jack. No DJ set.
Audience Member
Getting a little back to the technical side of things. I was just wondering
what do you guys use to sync up your computers?
Gernot Bronsert 
An ethernet cable. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
OUC.
Audience Member
Slightly less technical question, you have had a lot of really amazing
producers do remixes for you. Do you approach these people purely because
you’re into their music, or because of profile, or both? And which is your
favorite remix that you have had done for you? And another one quickly, is
there anyone who is obviously alive that you would love to remix your stuff and hasn’t yet?
Gernot Bronsert 
I cannot tell you which is my favorite, maybe you have a favorite? [turning to Sebastian] It
wouldn’t be fair to say, “OK, the remix producer X did is the best.”

Not the best because they all tend to be pretty good but maybe a personal
[favorite]?
Gernot Bronsert 
I am pretty much into this Siriusmo stuff. I don’t know if you have heard of this guy. I’m pretty impressed by him
because I don’t get him, I don’t get what he is doing. He’s actually mastering
his new record for our Monkeytown label. We
started a label just a year ago called Monkeytown.
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Don’t send demos to us, please.
Gernot Bronsert 
We started the label just because of Siriusmo, because of this guy. He gave me
tracks and I was so depressed because it was too good, it was just too good. I
think the stuff and the remixes he did they were amazing, but I was so
impressed by the remix that Marcel Dettmann did for us, which is totally the
way you are talking about, but this is next-level quality. For us, it is a new thing to
get remixes because before we dropped the last record we just did remixes for
other people. And then we got these amazing remixes from all these amazing
musicians from this planet.

On that note, knowing all you guys’ applications and knowing you have a
certain love for a band from this country, how did your perception change
when, all of a sudden, people like Thom Yorke were name-checking you all the
time and asking for remixes and stuff?
Gernot Bronsert 
We couldn’t believe it. It’s still pretty unreal. When someone asks me, “How
is Thom? How is Colin? How is
Björk?” I cannot tell you. It’s
like being on a rush. There was one crazy moment. We played in New York at
Studio B and we had a good time, and
backstage was a lot of friends, and then the club promoter came in, like, “Björk is coming. Björk! Whoa. Björk is coming.” Then Björk came in and we ended up
singing “Jump” from Kriss
Kross. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
And the moment that she came in,
it was so quiet. Thirty people.
Gernot Bronsert 
Just boys, talking about beats and cars, YouPorn, and then everything changed. For me, when we toured with
Radiohead, that was for me the experience of
how big it is possible to be. The whole production was just amazing, how they work,
and very interesting. I think we released the first record called “In
Loving Memory” in 2002 on BPitch Control. We just did a one-off thing, just release it and that was it. Thom Yorke was on a German MTV show and he
talked about us, this record, and I think this is one of the reasons why we
said, “OK, it’s not that bad. Let’s continue.” 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
We were very nervous in that moment. Can you imagine that? You receive 50
short messages on your phone.
Gernot Bronsert 
All your friends are like, “Thom Yorke!” He is cooking his tea with water anyway, so... like everybody.
Torsten Schmidt 
Do we have another question? Do you want to send us off with either a video or
something live or both?
Gernot Bronsert 
[turning to Sebastian] Techno or electro or hip-hop or grime? It’s a little bit old-fashioned, I know. 
Sebastian “Charlie” Szary 
Let’s make a surprise.
Gernot Bronsert 
UK funky is too new. [asking audience] Live or video? OK.
Torsten Schmidt 
I guess this would be the official end of everything involving a mic so
please get up and thank the boys. [applause]
