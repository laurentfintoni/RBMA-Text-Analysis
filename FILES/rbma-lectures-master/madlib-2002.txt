Egon 
We got, all the way from Los Angeles, California, Otis Jackson, aka Madlib, Quasimoto, Yesterdays New Quintet [laughs].
Madlib 
[hiding behind the turntables] What’s up, y’all?
Egon 
Give it up.
Madlib 
[stands up] Just playing. Peace!
Egon 
Where were you born, Mr. Madlib?
Madlib 
Saturn.
Egon 
Like Sun Ra?
Madlib 
That’s my pops, basically.
Egon 
Sun Ra?
Madlib 
Sun RZA.
Egon 
Your musical father?
Madlib 
Sun RZA.
Egon 
First music you fell in love with?
Madlib 
Jazz. I was listening to jazz when I was six and seven. My uncle is Jon
Faddis, he played with Dizzy Gillespie and Roy Ayers and all them
cats. And I basically got up in his record collection, stole all his joints, that’s how I started making beats.
Egon 
What year?
Madlib 
I started making beats in like ’87, got serious in ’96.
Egon 
’96, but you were making beats for people before that, like Alkaholiks and all that.
Madlib 
I got serious with the business in ’96 with my stuff.
Egon 
But the first productions you did were actually released in the early ’90s, Tha Alkaholiks, right?
Madlib 
Hmm, yeah. Let’s forget that one. ’Liks. Let’s get on my thang, you know?
Egon 
[laughs] Lootpack, independent hip-hop group from Oxnard, Santa Barbara, California.
Madlib 
Oxnard area.
Egon 
Tell ’em about the Lootpack, Otis.
Madlib 
Lootpack’s like the first group that I grew up with. We started breakdancing in the ’80s. You know, we went to school, fourth, fifth grade, sixth grade, we’ve been hanging ever since and been recording since the late ’80s.
Egon 
Put out your first record in ’95 or ’96?
Madlib 
Yeah, my pops put out my first single on Crate Diggaz Palace Records in ’96. That
consisted of Lootpack, which is me, Romes and BlackJack.
Egon 
Psyche Move EP. Your father was a musician too. He knew a little bit about the independent game, right?
Madlib 
Yeah my pops had a few records out, independent records arranged by H.B.
Barnum, David Axelrod’s homeboy. He’s still doing his thing, you know how it goes.
Egon 
Very notable soul vocalist from California, his father, Otis Jackson Sr. So Peanut Butter Wolf, the guy who owns Stones Throw, heard the Psyche Move, signed you to a deal and you put out an album, right?
Madlib 
Yeah, I got mad albums.
Egon 
But the first one was Lootpack Soundpieces, same people you just told us about.
Madlib 
Yeah. I'll make an album in a day.
Egon 
Was it like that back then?
Madlib 
It was worse back then, you know what I’m saying?
Egon 
And they were all on cassette tapes.
Madlib 
Just like I’m doing it at the hotel, making a beat tape on cassette.
Egon 
And spending his time in Brazil making music saving them onto cassette and
then destroying all the original files.
Madlib 
[crazy gesture] Yippie!
Egon 
So then, tell us about Quasimoto.
Madlib 
Quasimoto came after Lootpack. Basically, I was in the studio on some mushrooms by myself and I didn’t have no MCs around, and when I rap I don’t like my voice anyways, so I wanted to try something different. Just locked myself in the studio, just bugged out, just tried to speed my voice up and people liked that more than my first album.
Egon 
But you made that all on an 8-track cassette.
Madlib 
Oh, for sure. It don’t matter what you record on, or what you use. Basically, it’s what you do.
Egon 
So an entire album, the whole Quasimoto The Unseen, do we have a CD
here? The TASCAM Portastudio and it was in Spin magazine top 20 of the year in 2000, was it? How much did it cost to record that?
Madlib 
Well, just for the ’shrooms. That’s it.
Egon 
[laughs] Fifty bucks.
Madlib 
Had to buy the ’shrooms.
Egon 
This is a song from it.
(music: Quasimoto – “Come On Feet”) 
Madlib 
Y’all know.
Egon 
So that’s you, both voices?
Madlib 
Yeah.
Egon 
Two characters? Production, scratching, all you?
Madlib 
Yeah, luckily. Thanks to Jah.
Egon 
Were you a DJ before you were an MC?
Madlib 
I’m a DJ, I’m not no MC.
Egon 
What happened after Quasimoto? What did you decide to do next?
Madlib 
I bought some instruments ’cause I listen to all them records with Fender Rhodes and vibraphones and upright bass and stuff, so I wanted to see if I can get all that stuff and try to learn it and do my own thing, you know? Try to do what they did but in my own way.
Egon 
So, first you had, what, a Fender Rhodes?
Madlib 
Yeah, I bought a Fender Rhodes and two weeks later I had my first album.
Egon 
How did you make it? What did you do? What was the process involved in making this jazz music?
Madlib 
Studying the records that I like and just sit there and do it. Make yourself do it.
Egon 
What year jazz music? Are you talking about ’50s jazz, ’40s jazz, hard bop?
Madlib 
Like ’60s and ’70s, but with a future twist to it.
Egon 
So what records were you trying to play over when you were trying to do your first covers?
Madlib 
Like Lonnie Liston Smith, Elvin Jones, all that Black Jazz stuff, Strata East, whatever.
Egon 
[to audience] How many of you know the name Weldon Irvine? Famous composer,
arranger, jazz pianist, passed away just a little while ago. We played him
some of the early Yesterdays New Quintet stuff including a cover of one of
Weldon’s songs, a famous song called “Deja Vu.” Do you have any examples of
any of that stuff?
Madlib 
Yup. Actually, this is a song for him when he passed. I did a whole album for that cat.
(music: Monk Hughes & The Outer Realm – “Time”)
Egon 
What’s that one called?
Madlib 
 “Time.”
Egon 
Those were all samples, the drums and all that stuff?
Madlib 
Actually, there’s a bass loop under that and I played upright to it. Everything else is live.
Egon 
So you played the drums...
Madlib 
One mic.
Egon 
...and upright bass and all those keyboards and everything. How did you record this stuff, the Yesterdays New Quintet, that’s what you call the group, right?
Madlib 
First, I get the drums, you got to get the drums first. After that, it’s whatever. I just sit down, you know me, fifteen minutes and I’m done.
Egon 
What machine do you use? I mean, you have to record it somehow.
Madlib 
Just a little 8-track board.
Egon 
Digital or are you still doing cassettes?
Madlib 
Both.
Egon 
Cassettes for some stuff.
Madlib 
I ain’t abandoning the analogue.
[music continues]
Egon 
When you do sample stuff, what kind of sampler do you use nowadays?
Madlib 
My homie [shows Boss SP-303 Dr. Sample].
Egon 
What exactly is that?
Madlib 
You could do any type of music on this.
Egon 
What? You made all of that on this?
Madlib 
[nods] All my hip-hop stuff.
Egon 
Is that a Boss Dr. Sample or is that a 303?
Madlib 
303, like whatever, cheap, cheap.
Egon 
[shows to participants] Dr. Sample SP-303.
Madlib 
Anybody could do a beat, you just got to use your brain.
Egon 
Do you use the SP-1200?
Madlib 
SP, MP, but mainly that [points to Dr. Sample].
Egon 
You haven’t given up hip-hop completely though? You’re still producing hip-hop tracks, doing remixes?
Madlib 
Basically, when I go to the next style I do, I still have the stuff that I did back then. It’s always going to be the same, but I always progress too.
Egon 
So you’re working on some new hip-hop stuff now?
Madlib 
I’m working on new hip-hop, new jazz, reggae, soul, soundtracks, trying to do some scores.
Egon 
Jay Dee and MF Doom, two people you’re working with right now. [to audience] Y’all know the name Jay Dee? Slum Village and all that? MF Doom, used to be known as Zev Love X of KMD? Got anything new that we can hear? Maybe something with MF Doom?
Madlib 
Kind of raw.
Egon 
You recorded all this with the 303 and a smaller digital board?
Madlib 
True.
(music: Madvillian – “America’s Most Blunted”)
Madlib 
Weird shit.
Egon 
MF Doom. Anything else on that you want to play?
Madlib 
Some live shit.
(music: Madvillain – “Great Day”)
Egon 
[comments over music] This is you playing all the instruments?
Madlib 
Just a bass loop.
Egon 
Very nice. [to audience] You like what you’re hearing?
[applause]
Madlib 
Thank you.
Egon 
And you recorded all that with one microphone for basically, what? A dollar, a dollar fifty maybe, what ever it costs to buy discs?
Madlib 
For sure.
Egon 
And that’s going to be released on a major label, as major as we can get it. Probably going to sell 30-40,000 copies and the recording costs are zero. So anybody out there who thinks you have to go to a studio, I mean, you’re doing all that at the house with minimal equipment.
Madlib 
I do it at home, where I’m peaceful, relaxed and cool.
Egon 
How about some of this Jay Dee stuff? Do you have anything there you’re rapping on or anything?
(music: Jaylib – “Raw Addict” / applause)
Madlib 
Thank you, wow. Five claps, count the claps.
(music: Jaylib – “Survival Test”)
Madlib 
One more cut.
(music: Jaylib – unknown / applause)
Egon 
Very nice.
Madlib 
Thank you.
Egon 
Now, you got to explain something ’cause weren’t those vocals and all those cuts recorded on an 8-track cassette?
Madlib 
It’s not the final recording, it’s the rough draft, but basically...
Egon 
Sounded pretty good to me. Anything else you’ve been wroking on?
Madlib 
Ah, got some weird shit. Some Azymuth.
(music: Yesterdays New Quintet – unknown Azymuth tribute track)
Egon 
You said that’s Azymuth, ’A-Zee-Moochie’?
Madlib 
Who knows Azymuth, ’A-Zee-Moochie’? Man, y’all better get hip. I ain’t from here, but that’s dope music from here.
Egon 
So how many pseudonyms do you have ’cause you’re doing all these projects
under different names?
Madlib 
I don’t know, there’s going to be more. I don’t know, something like 20 or
more.
Egon 
Are you nervous that people might not catch on that it’s you doing all this stuff?
Madlib 
It’s good, that’s what I want. I want them to think that it’s somebody else.
Egon 
Questions? I guess, we should open it up right now.
Audience Member
On the Azymuth track, were you playing drums live? Was everything live on that?
Madlib
Yeah, everything was live. Slapping the bass like I’m from the ’80s.
Audience Member
Do you play the drums on something and then sample them or do you just play the whole thing live?
Madlib
Yes.
Audience Member
You play the whole thing live all the way  through and then you layer everything on top of that.
Madlib
Yes.
Audience Member
So your foundation track is the drums?
Madlib
Yes, sir.
Egon
Anyone else? Anymore questions before we get out of here?
Audience Member 
You were saying your studio costs nothing, but it’s necessary to have a good studio as well, I mean, in the end, isn’t it?
Egon 
Not for us. We’ve been doing just fine. We don’t really pay much. I mean, we might pay $50 an hour for someone mastering it with ProTools. Pretty much everything is recorded at the house. The M.F. Doom project is going to be recorded at the house, the Jay Dee stuff is recorded at the house. Everything you heard with the exception of the Lootpack album has been recorded for free.
Madlib 
Bedroom style.
Egon 
Cheap boards. And we try to do our best to make it presentable. You've heard our music, you can play it in clubs. I mean, I heard my man Primo [the Brazilian DJ], playing “Whenimondamic” and it sounded pretty good to me.
Audience Member 
But having a proper mix on a quite big table [mixing desk], you don't think it would bring more to the music?
Madlib 
Probably, but I’m not even on that tip. I’m just trying to do it and then go on to the next. That’s just something I did that day and then I'm going on to the next thing. I don’t have time to run into a big studio. Just do that real quick and put it on DAT, and it's cool.
Egon
That’s a good point that you made. Ultimately – I can answer this because I’m there trying to mix all of this stuff – if he records something in a day, chances are by that evening it’s all been erased. He makes one CD. If we’re lucky enough to know that he’s made it, we’ll make dubs for ourselves. Sometimes hundreds of songs are lost because the discs get thrown around. He just makes the music, mixes it to his specifications, and moves on. It’s up to us to pick what sounds good enough, master that, and put it out. In the case of some, we mix it down, but for the most part none of it is mixed down. It’s mixed down, but it’s mixed down at the house.
Madlib
My mix.
Audience Member 
What are your influences? What are you listening to?
Madlib 
Music. King Tubby, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Iron Butterfly.
Egon 
How about hip-hop guys?
Madlib 
Marcos Valle. Hip-hop-wise, Ultramagnetic MCs, Rakim, that’s about it. I mean, there’s a gang of influences, but it’s too many that’s why my music always changes. I always get influenced.
Audience Member 
Have you listened to some electronic experimental stuff, like Warp, Squarepusher, Aphex Twin?
Madlib 
Yeah, I could do that, too.
[laughter]
Audience Member 
You rock, man.
Madlib 
Just try to do every type of music, so you can connect with everybody.
Audience Member 
Madlib, besides the Dr. Sample, are you using drum machines or anything like that?
Madlib 
That is a drum machine.
Audience Member 
But besides that one, no?
Madlib 
I use a SP-1200 and an MPC sometimes.
Audience Member 
Anything acoustic?
Madlib 
I have an acoustic upright bass, electric basses, vibraphone, Fender Rhodes, ARPs, drums, guitars, whatever. Percussion, bought some percussion today.
Audience Member 
What kind of effects do you use?
Madlib 
[looks at the Dr. Sample display] Phaser, tremolo, fuzz, wah, octave, equalizer, slicer, ring mod, tape echo, chorus, flanger, reverb. [laughter]
Mainly the wah wah.
Audience Member 
How would you define ’keeping it real’?
Madlib 
I don’t define it, I just do what I do. That word is so played out, so many definitions. Just keep it real myself, I guess, I don’t know.
Audience Member 
When you are recording the drums first do you use any kind of metronome or something like that?
Madlib 
In my head, yeah. That’s why some of that stuff is off-beat but that’s how I like my stuff.
Audience Member 
Do you use sequencers or just the pads on the sampler?
Madlib 
Sometimes I do it live, sometimes I sequence, but I usually like to do 'human time': record the drums, go to the next track and record the bass. I don’t use computers. I’m a caveman [laughter].
Audience Member 
I find it incredible that you picked up almost all of the instruments that you play in no time, has that anything to do with your father?
Madlib 
Probably, yeah. But I didn’t know any of that before I stepped to it. Like anybody else, I just had to do what I had to do, doing it 20 hours a day. Discipline.
Audience Member 
What’s your singing voice like?
Madlib 
You want me to do it? No, I’m playing, it’s not good. It’s not good.
Audience Member 
Mad, you said that you don’t use computers, how do you take your music from your home studio to the mastering [studio]?
Egon 
I do all that. Or Peanut Butter Wolf.
Audience Member 
And what’s impossible to do in the Dr. Sample, like technically? Like, long samples...
Madlib 
Oh, it has like 10-15 minutes on it, a gang of effects. It’s just small, so people are like 'urgh.'
Audience Member 
You can link it with the SP?
Madlib 
Yeah.
Audience Member 
Have you done a live act as Quasimoto or Yesterdays New Quintet?
Madlib 
Yeah I try to...
Audience Member 
What would you do if you did a proper live [show] of every project?
Madlib 
For the Yesterdays, I haven’t put a band together yet. I need a band to do that, that can play how I want it to sound, and that hasn’t happened yet, but it’s in the works. As far as Quasimoto, I try to do that and the sound man was using effects, so the effects don’t always work properly, so. When I recorded the album, I didn’t use effects, I just sped up the tape. So, I went out there and did my first Quasimodo show and my voice was regular in a crazy suit like a space... you know how Quas looks, that’s the suit I came out in. And it was just crazy, most embarrassing time of my life, you know what I’m sayin.
