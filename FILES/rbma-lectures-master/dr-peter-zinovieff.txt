Torsten Schmidt 
It’s going to be a rather mind-boggling day because you’re going to have very
different approaches within very few hours. It is with very great pleasure
that we welcome Dr Peter Zinovieff.
[applause]
That wasn’t even close to the right pronunciation, was it? What would it be,
Zee-nov-e-eff?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Zin-ov-e-eff.
Torsten Schmidt
And how did you come to have a name like that in the heart of the British
Empire?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Empire? I didn’t realize there was one, but my blood is all Russian, my
parents are Russian.
Torsten Schmidt 
But you were born out here?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I was, in London.
Torsten Schmidt
But you’re not in London any more, right?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, I live in Cambridge, with my wife [points to his wife].
Torsten Schmidt
Please welcome her as well.
[applause]
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
What we’re listening to in the background is part of
Chronometer, which
I did with Harrison
Birtwistle, it just came
out last year. It’s the first quad sound classical music piece.
So, it’s released as a DVD with an ordinary CD sound on one side and quad on
the other.
Torsten Schmidt
Could you explain in layman’s terms what quad sound is?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It means quadraphonic. This
piece was designed with Birtwistle in about 1970. You’ll see later from the
slides what the studio looked like then. But it was made as a quadraphonic
piece, it was one of the first quadraphonic pieces. This is only being played
in stereo now. But it was a milestone. The original recording was found last
year and then made into this DVD.
Torsten Schmidt
What was it recorded on?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I suppose, it was recorded on 4-track
Ampexes and perhaps an 8-track
Studer.
Torsten Schmidt
And how would you set up a system, if you want to play it in pre-Dolby
5.1 scenarios?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
A lot of luck, but it was actually under computer control, so the sync was
done with computer control. In fact, Ray
Dolby lived down the road from where
my studio was and he gave us his prototypes to use before he was a household
name.
Torsten Schmidt
There’s maybe about five people in this room who actually might remember
Dolby. That’s the sign that helped your tapes to have less noise, right?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yeah, it’s on every film.
Torsten Schmidt
So, there’s an actual person of that name?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, he’s like Bob Moog or is it Charles Hoover, who invented the [vacuum
cleaner].
Torsten Schmidt 
So, when you say it was done with computer help in 1970, I remember in about
‘76, when I was very, very little, my dad was working in the military and he
brought this little thing home and said, “Son, this is a computer and it will
help us play a board game because it’s got six LED lights and it will be our
dice.” And I’m like [looks baffled], “Why? Wouldn’t it be a lot easier just
to roll the dice and not to use this thing?”
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, my first computer was much before that, I think it was 1964 or something
like that, perhaps even earlier. It was a Digital Equipment
PDP-8 and it was the first computer in a
private house in the world. So, I have had a computer longer than anybody in
the world [laughter / applause]. That’s very good, isn’t it? And talking
about random numbers, it’s not very easy to get a computer to play dice, it’s very
difficult. What often happens is the series of numbers that comes out, you can
recognize it as repetitive. So, what I did was to have a luminous watch and a
Geiger counter and it recorded spontaneous radioactivity, and from that we derived random numbers, and that was true randomness.
Torsten Schmidt 
Excuse my ignorance, but why would you have a Geiger counter in the house?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Because it was very difficult to get random numbers, it was purely to get
random numbers. It was almost impossible to write a mathematical function that
will give non-repetitive series.
Torsten Schmidt
That probably helps, because I was wondering when I found the unit again 20
years later, I was like, “Hang on, it’s got six LED’s, but the manual is at
least double that volume [points to mixer]. What did they teach them with
that?”
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, you were lucky. Nowadays, there’s never a manual, so you have to look at
PDF files and it’s only on the last page you find out where you want to find
out. The days of manuals were wonderful.
Torsten Schmidt
Manuals weren’t so helpful as far as context or text search, though.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It’s only nowadays that people can’t turn pages fast. It’s a ridiculous idea
to have a book that goes “next page, next page” [gestures turning pages] and
then you want to go to page five and you don’t know if it’s page five or
50. It’s terrible. You all agree?
Torsten Schmidt
All the manual labor that goes into flicking the page.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It’s terrible [laughter].
Torsten Schmidt
But still, we’re talking about a time when the vast majority of the public
didn’t know what a computer was. How did you end up with one in your home?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Because I had a marvelous engineer called David
Cockerell, who will probably go down as the best electronic music
engineer that’s ever been. He had the great gift, or I had the great gift of
thinking of something that I wanted and I’d ring him up and he’d make it.
However difficult it was, he’d make it. Then, one day he said the only way to
control this multitude of oscillators, amplifiers, tape recorders — a huge
array, you’ll see a slide of it in a bit — he said the only way to control
this was to have a computer. Computers in those days were used in factories
for just that sort of thing: turn that on, turn this off, switches. That’s how
it was first used, as a process control thing.
Torsten Schmidt
Obviously, you didn’t just go to an online shop or somewhere down the 
street. Where would you obtain the parts for it?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, there was a company called Digital Equipment Corporation in
America. I remember very well when I bought it, they offered a course to go and
learn how to use it. At the end of the course, I had no idea what to do,
absolutely none. The course was for people who already used computers in a
massive way, with decks of cards and things. So, I said to him, “I’ll give you
a case of whisky if you can tell me how I could control an oscillator.” He
said, “Tad-I-Auto.” “Tad-I-Auto,” in the language of that computer meant, “Take a
number, put it somewhere, then go back and take the next number, which will be
the next in the stack, and give it [out].” Just by that, I realized you could take
numbers sequentially and give them to an oscillator, so the sound would change.
It was worth that conversation, the case of whisky for “Tad-I-Auto.”
Torsten Schmidt
What sort of whisky was it? Did he share some with you [laughter]? Obviously, no.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
A bit left [holds up glass].
Torsten Schmidt
That was your eureka moment.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It was, exactly.
Torsten Schmidt
Just to give us some perspective, that’s just one bit of information at a
time, one notch on whatever information parameter is changing on the
oscillator, so you would have to repeat exactly that operation a lot of times.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Thousands of times a second, yes, to make a piece like this. This piece, you
just pressed a button “Go,” and the whole piece came out. It was very amazing,
really.
Torsten Schmidt
So, what were you doing at the time when you said, “I’ve got all these things
and I want to do this”?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Originally, I was a geologist, that’s why this talk is called Geology And
Music. Also, the middle part is I was also a librettist for Harrison
Birtwistle and wrote the libretto for
The Mask Of Orpheus, a big
opera.
Torsten Schmidt
Could you enlighten us as to what a librettist does?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
A librettist writes the scenario and the words, the plot of a play, then the
composer writes the music. So, this was a very big opera. The point of this
talk is that exactly the same thought processes perhaps go on, whether you’re
a geologist making a map, whether you’re a writer making a libretto, or whether you’re a composer doing
computer music or electronic music. Although it seems like a wild idea, I hope
by the end you’ll see that I actually use the same triangles in all of these
different disciplines.
Torsten Schmidt
Before we jump into this, so that people get… actually, you’re getting there,
your involvement with a certain company that we might know these days. That’s
part of the presentation as well, right?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
EMS. I brought along a very
old Synthi, a prototype for a Synthi A. I had this computer music
studio and the only way we could finance it was by selling synthesizers. The
studio wasn’t financed by the government or anything else, so we made the
synthesizers and they were the bread and butter for what I thought the more
important work. I never used them, I really feel shy about putting a pin in.
Fortunately, it’s been set up now and we’ll have a lovely demonstration of it
later. Anyone can play with this. It’s like a museum piece. Extraordinarily
enough, people are wanting these old analog synthesizers more and more now.
I can’t imagine why, really, because it’s so amazing what people can do with
actual computers now. It’s not my world.
Torsten Schmidt
So, the whole fetish for these machines is alien to you?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It is. My whole philosophy at the beginning was to do away with cutting tape,
which is how people made electronic music at first; slicing tape, sticking
together with Sellotape, roughly. This seemed such a terrible idea, which is why I developed the sequencer. This reminds me a bit of tape days, taking a pin, putting it somewhere, hoping
there’s a sound, turning the level up, it not being exactly accurate. But
there are lots of people who disagree with me over that.
Torsten Schmidt
There was somewhere in the time you just mentioned, and that’s when you
worked on the sequencer. Now, sequencers are the foundation for what most of us
do in digital audio platforms. Just like that?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, it’s to have one sound after another sound. The first sequencer I made
was based on a uniselector,
which is how old-fashioned telephones worked. You dialed a number and as the
dial went back [draws circle in the air] it went pip-pip-pip. The more
pips, the bigger the number, so nought had the maximum number and one only
had one pip. At the exchange, this was a sequence of numbers that came in
and it would recognize the sequence of numbers and connect you to the right
telephone. That’s exactly what I used in the first sequencers. The first
sequencer I made was using that telephone technique like that, and these relays
would go around making these shuttering noises. It would switch on and off
different oscillators, and I think that was the first sequencer in the world.
Torsten Schmidt
When did you hear about other people working on similar concepts?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I didn’t believe anybody was working on anything like it. Then, by chance, I
met Max Mathews at Bell
Labs and he was doing exactly similar
work with a program called Groove. Then, after we had
done these synthesizers, who should turn up but a fellow called
Moog in America. I’d never heard of
him, thought he must have copied us. So, it was very strange working in
parallel, but unknown to each other.
Torsten Schmidt
Well, I guess those of you who were around — which is probably two people in
this room, if I see correctly — but it was quite a common thing to annoy the
fuck out of your parents or grandparents by playing with the telephone,
because that relay sound was so beautiful in a way. It was a similar
fascination.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
The best thing was it was called “phone freaking,” wasn’t it? You could tap
the number and avoid the exchange and the ultimate phone freak was to tap
enough so it would go from satellite to satellite to satellite and come back
to you with a noise like this, “Shhhhhhhh!” Then you knew you’d gone around the
world 25 times and it was successful, that was the goal [laughter].
Torsten Schmidt
You said you did it out of necessity, and then you heard about the Moogs of
this world. When did you realize there was enough there to make a living out
of it, or to turn it into a business venture?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I think we did it at the same time or before Moog. We started and at one point
we nearly bought him up, he nearly went broke. But we just couldn’t afford it.
I wish we had, from a commercial point of view. He once came when we made the
VCS-3, he sat on my floor in my
studio and he thought it was marvelous. The idea of leads was even worse than
cutting up tape, to have leads connecting from one place, like we’ve got here,
they still exist. It’s extraordinary, in a few years we won’t have these.
Torsten Schmidt
That’s what we all hope. So, with the VCS, these things are very, very sought
after now, but they never – weirdly enough – got the same recognition in their time. Is that
because you never had the same business partner backing you up as some of the
Americans had?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Partly. When they were just taking off and doing very well, we were going to go
public in America. But my company, EMS, got cheated by our American partners,
who gave us a duff check and then the company collapsed. It was a very sad
story, really, because once we couldn’t sell these machines, then the studio
collapsed. The studio was taken over by the National Theatre here in London.
At that time, it was huge, hundreds and hundreds of leads connecting
everything. You’ll see in one of the pictures. They put it in the basement,
the basement leaked and the last time I saw it all this equipment was covered
with exercise bicycles and water. It was a terrible thing. A few of the
Ampexes survived, but that was the end of that disgraceful story.
Torsten Schmidt
Is that the same place you talk about? Because I don’t know how these things
end up online, but we found a page from a diary from 1976 where you talk about
rain coming in…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, that was into my studio, that was in Computer Arts Magazine. I don’t know how it got online, but
that was a week in the busy life of my studio.
Torsten Schmidt
Do you recall, because there’s a great analogy about this movie and when the
Tatars took over this church or
monastery?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
That’s right. Rublev was the name of
the film and after the Tatars come and sack the whole town, and
Rublev, who’s the greatest
painter of icons…
Audience member
It’s an Andrei Tarkovsky film.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes. Then, in this great cathedral when it burns down, he says, “It’s very sad
when it rains in a cathedral.” And it was like that — it was very sad when it
rained on my studio.
Torsten Schmidt
I guess, we’ve got a bit of context, so we can start what you’re really going
to talk about, so people won’t go, “Where are we?”
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I must explain a bit about this, but unfortunately some of the slides don’t seem
to work, so I’ll have to try to skip them on. Also, this is a new laptop of
mine and I don’t seem able to liaise it properly, so I’ll have to do the
presentation from there. It’s alright, but there’ll be a few hiccups. Also, if
anyone wants to just stop me at any point, this is meant to be light
entertainment [laughter]… So, shall I start or are there any questions at the moment? [pause]
OK. [Starts slides] So, here I’m saying that science, a geological
map, and a libretto and electronic composition were three lucky involvements
of mine, all completely different, but they were very lucky. [Film starts]
Does it go on or not? This is a synthesized voice, possibly one of the first
big synthesized voices of a crofter in the north-west of Scotland telling a
story. Here’s where the crofter was… this is a steamer, there is the Isle of
Skye opposite, and note the tidal shore where the tide goes up and down. That
whole area was a wonderful, wonderful volcano about 30 million years ago in
the tertiary times. This is what it looks like now, and when I was at Oxford
doing a doctorate this was the area I had to map. In those days, I had
a band with a biscuit tin and that was the closest I came to electronic music,
but that was a long time ago. Here’s another view. I stayed in this bothy
there and I had to map these mountains. That’s what climbing was like in those
days, so it shows how long ago it was.
Audience member 
Is that you?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yeah, it is. I was interested in music then, as you can see, and I had my own
synthesizer when I was camping. I mapped it onto aerial photographs and
analyzed the rocks, finding little details and the various layers, just like
in a musical composition. So, I analyzed those and looked in the tiny details,
like the crystals, looking for little peculiarities; like sampling, it’s very
much like sampling. And here is more detail. I’ll play a piece later, which
will show how this works and what I’m doing at the moment. The scale of
everything is completely important in geology — are you dealing with big or
little things? Each contributes to the whole. The structure, which is like a
composition, here’s the actual chemical structure of a rock. Here’s the
structure of an Ultimate computer music piece, which says, “Please make me a
composition” to a computer. Here is a structure of Act III, and you’ll see
each of these looks very similar. There’s the structure of the crystal,
there’s the Ultimate computer composition with things like tension, surprise,
dependency, randomness all in there. And there’s the structure of the third
act of a libretto. And there’s the final geological map. So, that’s the end of
the geology bit.

[Video plays]
Torsten Schmidt
For the non-native speakers, what’s a whippet?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
That was my studio down at the bottom there overlooking the Thames.
Torsten Schmidt
Whippet is a dog.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
So, this was a very, very exciting piece I did with Hans Werner Henze. It was wonderful, from
whipping the piano with whips to wonderful Italian meals, it was a terrific
adventure.
Torsten Schmidt
How did the Italian meals get in there?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Because Hans brought over his assistant Fausto who cooked all these meals. It
was a month or two of wonderful, wonderful times.
Torsten Schmidt
Doesn’t sound too bad. And LSO stands for? Maybe you
want to pause this for a second.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
London Symphony Orchestra. This is recording for the clocks in Chronometer. This
is in the Science Museum, the world’s clock, then we went up to the top of Big
Ben and recorded all the different little mechanisms.
Torsten Schmidt
Can you actually enlighten us, if we pause this for a moment, one thing we
notice is when you go past churches here they seem to be terribly out of tune.
Not like a good German church bell [laughs].
Audience member
The bells, you mean?
Torsten Schmidt
Yes, they seem to be playing a weird off-rhythms.
Audience member
It might just be the ropes rather than the mechanism doing it, that might be
the difference.
Torsten Schmidt
You think so?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I think you’re wrong [laughter], I think this is bell-ringing proper here.
Torsten Schmidt
Oh well, I thought it might just be from clocks to bells…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This is a video that doesn’t work. The point of this is this was a wonderful
exhibition called Cybernetic
Serendipity. At this
point, people came along and whistled into the computer. The computer would analyze
the whistle and would often guess what the person was going to whistle next. I
took several of the most popular tunes that people would whistle and the
computer, a massive great thing, would make tunes out of the whistles. This
was a very, very important advance in robot electronic music and it’s still
talked about today, it was a real milestone this exhibition in 1970 of
Cybernetic Serendipity.
Audience member 
[inaudible]
Dr Peter Zinovieff: 
Yes.
Audience member 
Were these computers all fully transistorized?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Transistors. One could actually repair a module of memory. This computer,
which was half the size of the wall behind me, I suppose, had 8k of memory. In
the end we got a 32k hard drive, which was huge. We never thought we could
fill it [laughter] and it was 32k. On this little computer here, I’ve got 4gb
of memory and half a terabyte of disc space. The difference between that, from
8k to 4gb is completely amazing. That computer cost a fortune, this one cost a
few hundred pounds.
Torsten Schmidt
Did you have any benefactors to come up with that fortune?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I did… we’ll come to that in a bit. This was one of the first studios I built,
so there were quite a lot of leads. [Video starts again] Those were
oscillators. [Video continues] That’s David Cockerell. [Video pauses]
Actually, eating a lump of sugar was meant to be… That was David Cockerell.
Torsten Schmidt
So, that was part of a longer documentary that’s available online?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes. [Video starts again] This is the rain I was talking about falling into
my computer.
Audience member
Which piece did you work on with
Stockhausen?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It wasn’t a piece, he just came and fiddled around, really.
Torsten Schmidt
As he does.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This is how the studio gradually developed into something much smarter than
that. These are my three children and this is an advertisement for the future
of opera. I didn’t, at this stage, know I would be involved in making an opera.
And we made these crazy advertisements: “Every picnic needs a Synthi,
everybody needs a Synthi, every band.”
[video continues]
Torsten Schmidt
That’s like the ultimate triple-X for most of us.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Then we invented a vocoder, the first vocoder, now used a lot, but this was our
advertisement. A lot of bands have used these. Pink
Floyd is a good example, they bought lots of
them. Every time they bought something, I could do some more experiments.
[video continues] 
So there’s my studio, I don’t know why it’s there, but
still. Here’s a new type of computer. I was very interested, still am, in
producing scores. I hope this will pause. This says, “Please make me a
beautiful composition.” After a bit, the computer answers and says, “This is a
beautiful composition, but do you know if it is?” So, you ask the computer
back, “Is this a beautiful composition?” And the computer, of course, says,
“Do you think it is?” And you have to answer, “I suppose it is, you made it.”
And the only answer you can do then is, “Please make me another beautiful
composition.” I think this is about the most succinct computer music score you
could have of those initials. On the other hand, behind this frivolous idea I
did have the idea of making a tetrahedron, coming back again to triangles, and
you could slice a tetrahedron and within it you’d have areas of tension like
expectation, surprise, greyness, dependency, tension. Wherever you cut this
tetrahedron, you would have a score where you would obey these emotional rules.
That was a very ambitious idea, that this was what computers would be able to
do.
Audience member 
That image is almost like cutting through strata in rock.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Again, it is, yes. Now we’re going onto the structure of Act III based on the
tides, which you saw at the beginning.
[Video starts]
Oh, a bit more first.
[Video continues] 
She’s now becoming famous, that’s Delia
Derbyshire starting it, who was my
colleague. There we have it sitting on the stage of the Queen Elizabeth Hall,
this ridiculous idea.
[Video continues]
[Cites video] 
Neo-Weber, that was fantastic.
[Slideshow continues]
So, this was the studio when I went to Oxford with it, that’s roughly what the
computer side of it looked like. That was all the paper, tape, the printer –
that was the computer set-up. These are more modern experiments.
(music: Orchestral Bach recording plays, followed by a computer-controlled interpretation played on a Yamaha piano)
DR PETER ZINOVIEFF
This is a very good quest, waveform to MIDI. This is a wild experiment, this
is a picture advertising Cambridge University alumni travel program, which
my wife did. I wondered, if you scan it into
Sibelius, what sort of sounds
could you get out of that instead of from a score. So, what do you think that picture
could give you? Do people here use Sibelius? This is using the scanning option
from that picture. So, it’s found the bow and it’s found points. 
There was a wonderful picture in a magazine called Source, again from 1970s, a very lavish American magazine, and there was a bloke with a huge bit of manuscript paper about 50
yards away and he had a machine gun and he’d been shooting at the score and so you
had bullet holes. Then he’d reduce the score and that’s what people would play.
This was the same sort of experiment. For me, it just seemed amazing that you
could get someone to play a piano and whatever they played would become a
score in front of your eyes. I’m very involved at the moment in this, I’m
working with a marvelous violinist and she’s playing directly into Sibelius.
[Video continues]
So, here’s a synthesizer, which is here, this is an older model of it, anyone
can play with it afterwards. Here are some programs I’m using at the moment –
some are being developed for me by York University. And this is part of a
piece I’m doing for a sculpture in Istanbul later this year. So, here we have
again this quest of waveform to MIDI, here’s
Beethoven being converted
into a MIDI file. Here’s an artificial singing program. There’s a rough
melody and that could be transformed, that Beethoven symphony could be
transformed. Here I’m using n-Track to collect a few
things from what we’ve been hearing together. There’s the MIDI file of
Beethoven, and my whippet, and other things will now come together. That’s a
part of a Henze, but distorted. At the back it’s still my whippet’s heart
going “boom-boom-boom: and the Beethoven dribbling along. 
Now we’ll move along
to the last part, which is the libretto, so here’s part of the Mask Of
Orpheus. 
(music: Peter Zinovieff - Selection from “The Mask Of Orpheus”) 
DR PETER ZINOVIEFF
It was originally for Covent Garden, but via Glyndebourne it ended up in the English National
Opera. So here are the tides, which you’ve seen before, both from the Isle of
Raasay and outside my house in Putney in London, where my first studio was.
Sometimes the studio would even flood when the Thames got high. Always been
terrible, really.
Audience member
Can you explain to people here about Harrison Birtwistle?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
He’s probably our most distinguished British composer. And he’s called
Harrison Birtwistle [laughter]. This is part of the structure of this
libretto, it’s not just a question of writing words and a singer singing them.
It’s also a very contrived artificial thing. For instance, I imagine that on a
beach are various objects, like a bit of fishing net, an old bit of
bone, a fossil or something. The tide comes up and covers each of these objects, then
the tide falls and uncovers these objects. Each time that they’re covered or
uncovered it triggers a dramatic scene, say, perhaps the death of Orpheus or
the rebirth of Orpheus. So, this structure of the tides falling and rising is the
structure of the whole of the Act III, which is about an hour long, in this opera.
In the same way, the staging, the type of masks people wear, the gestures they
make, everything is dependent on this thing, the tide moving up and down and
up again.
Torsten Schmidt
Is that a dedicated sign language there, or is that something you came up with?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It’s something I came up with to represent the main protagonists in the opera.
In the same way, it becomes so far away from language that I invented a special
language for them to speak. I used the words “Orpheus” and “Eurydice,” and out of
these syllables I invented a language that had its own context and grammar and
tenses and vocabulary and had to be written. I used an IBM typewriter — there
weren’t word processors in those days — and overlapped the letters, so that when the
singers had to sing them, they looked at something incomprehensible as well. So,
the language was incomprehensible in all sorts of ways. I don’t know if you
can see there, but the translation of English to Orphic is very complicated.
Although it’s simple, Orpheus might sing something like, “I can see an oar on
the shore.” But what he would say is [makes incomprehensible sound], which
has never been sung before, it’s untranslatable except as a notion. So, this is
a song in this invented language.
(music: Philip Langridge - Selection from “The Mask Of Orpheus”) 
This is by Philip Langridge,
who died two days ago. So, although this is an English opera, one can’t
understand what these words are. It’s very difficult inventing a new thing to
sing, these are professional singers and they have to learn it by heart.
Torsten Schmidt
So, you use these professional singers as professional components in you
synthesizing a language, basically?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
They had to sing it, it’s an opera, a proper full-scale opera. This is what
I’m involved in now, this sculpture, it’s on its way to Istanbul from Seville.
Bartók in the late 1930s
recorded a lot of folk songs in Turkey. Here is one [fiddles with slides].
This is the last slide. 
[music starts]
This is what you can get from the
archive now. I’m using this sort of song. This is Bartók recording on a wire
recorder.
Torsten Schmidt 
So, basically similar to what Ralph
Peer and the guys in America did,
just went out there and documented folk songs?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This is the sort of thing I’m doing now. You’ll hear in this the same
heartbeat that I emphasized in the beginning, the same Beethoven. Of course,
I’m doing all this on the computer, I’m not using any equipment at all. York
University, who control this sculpture, wherever it is, from York… This
sculpture has 150 loudspeakers in it. It must be the most elaborate sound
installation in the world, and it’s all controlled from York University.
Because I’m one of the composers producing music for it in Istanbul, York
University are making these amazing little programs and one of them allows
you to slow down music without changing pitch or losing any information.
Another one is an extraordinary filter bank, which has something like 2,000
filters, so I can do a graphic display and take out tiny little parts of the
sound, which I want. It’s incredibly luxurious to have these
Max/MSP programs being
made for me. Max/MSP is a music programmer’s delight, I think. It’s
complicated but wonderful, I’d recommend it to anyone. Expensive, though. 
This is my origins, a Russian troika, and that’s the end of this little
demonstration. I will now answer any questions about these slides or go back
to them. Thank you.
[applause]
Torsten Schmidt
I guess, before we open it up, there are a few questions flying around. OK, the
saucy ones first. Did we hear that right? Delia Derbyshire was your assistant
at some stage?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes.
Torsten Schmidt 
Lucky you.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I formed a group called Unit Delta Plus and I got Delia Derbyshire and Brian
Hodgson from the BBC to help me
in that.
Torsten Schmidt
Were they doing the Radiophonic Workshop already?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
They left the Radiophonic Workshop to join me. The idea was that we would make a
fortune doing commercial sounds, but I wasn’t interested in doing commercial
sounds. We did one for Philips, which was something like “Whoooop,” and that
was it. We got a lot of money for that, but I didn’t want to do
that, so we split. But they didn’t succeed either. I didn’t want to have a
commercial studio, I wanted an experimental studio, where good composers could
work and not pay. In fact, rather like this organization, the same sort of
philosophy. If anyone had a good project, they could come and work in my
studio and I wouldn’t charge them. It wasn’t just Henze and Birtwistle who
came, but quite a few. We often had Arts Council courses and perhaps 20 people
would come and study over a month, so in that way it’s very similar to [the]
Red Bull [Music Academy], I think.
Torsten Schmidt
Obviously, we can only judge it in retrospect and are amazed when we watch
documentaries on Radiophonic Workshop, but…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I’m amazed, too, because these archive films, I had no idea they existed until
a few years ago. So, it’s extraordinary for me to look and think this is
actually what happened.
Torsten Schmidt 
Can you recall what these people were doing in a very public environment — and
publicly funded as well — how they were perceived by you and your likes as well as the general public?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
The Radiophonic Workshop was really purely for sound effects on radio. It’s
become famous because of the Doctor
Who. But, otherwise, it
was a very primitive tape studio, not in any way a research studio. They
bought, for instance, EMS equipment and other equipment, but it was never
advanced in the way that Cologne was and
Utrecht was and Columbia. It wasn’t an academic or
research studio.
Torsten Schmidt
Who were your other customers at the time? You mentioned a few educational or
broadcasting facilities that were kind of mixed-roles. The Cologne facility,
as Professor Podmore would be able to
tell you, is still like this bizarre museum that no one was able to get into.
Massive chunks of money were sunk into these places, but who else could afford
these things?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Mainly radio stations and a few universities. Everybody bought little ones
like this, but the big Synthi 100, which was a bigger version of this... Perhaps
someone would come and hold it up [Interviewer holds up the synthesizer]. The other way
around, not to me.
Torsten Schmidt
I just want to be gentle.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This was a Synthi A, a very primitive one, the first one. We made a huge
version of this called the Synthi 100, and I think we made 30 or 40 of those.
Torsten Schmidt
Do you know how many of those are still around? We obviously only know the
pictures.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, I want to find one. If anyone knows of one, I’ll pay them some money
because I know I can sell it for a fortune.
Torsten Schmidt
I saw one on the internet that went for a six-digit figure.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
That’s it. I’m not going to tell where I think there are some. People talking
Orphic, you know?
Torsten Schmidt
What do you make of a German company now doing…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Ludwig Rehberg, he was my
German agent. In fact, Robin Wood, who was my studio assistant, now owns EMS and
he’s about to start up remaking a batch of VCS-3s, just exactly the same as
the originals, but they are going to cost a fortune. The whole idea of the
originals was that they’d be very cheap, and any musician could buy one, sort
of.
Torsten Schmidt
Yes, I think it said like £330 in the ads.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
For a VCS-3, yes.
Torsten Schmidt
But at the time, that was obviously a totally different £330 to now.
Audience member 
About half the price of a car.
Torsten Schmidt
Half the price of a car.
Audience member 
A small car.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
But you can’t really compare it, because there weren’t many electronic things
then.
Torsten Schmidt
But when you say you wanted every musician to be able to buy it, in the
end it was bands like Pink Floyd or The Who…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, we sold several thousand, so several thousand did buy them. It was the
same sort of price as the Moogs in America. You have to bear in mind that a
pocket calculator cost a lot of money then. A telephone cost a fortune, a mobile
telephone was very expensive. The fact that these things are much cheaper now
doesn’t mean that people wouldn’t have bought them then.
Torsten Schmidt
Still, how do you feel now when, even up until the late ’90s, having the
actual financial funds to obtain a physical unit was a big threshold for many
people doing music, whereas now, it’s more a matter of finding free wifi and a $300 computer.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, the programs for a computer are still quite expensive.
Torsten Schmidt
But it’s a lot easier to find another version of that than to steal a physical unit.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Let’s say you have a powerful enough computer to run a good computer synthesis
program and have MIDI input and all the things you want, you’re up to quite
a lot of money. You couldn’t just spend £500, you’d need a lot of data
storage, you’d need a lot of peripherals. What would it cost? Two thousand,
two-and-a-half-thousand pounds?
Torsten Schmidt
I think most people here would do it on a standard unit that’s below a grand.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
With input and amplifiers?
Torsten Schmidt
Amplification is a different thing, but most people just use their headphones,
if you look around.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
What you’re doing here is really the answer, to use lots of recording suites,
people to be able to come and go and have high-class equipment. It’s much
better to have limited facilities of very good equipment than to have a lot of
bad equipment going around. Also, on headphones you can’t really hear what
it’s going to sound like. The higher the quality of the programs you use,
the better the facility, the more you can do with it. It’s still nothing like
the end, it’s only the beginning of what you can do with computers. The
programs are terribly primitive, all of these mixing programs and the
stuff you can do with them. MIDI itself is incredibly naive, sampling is still
naive, it’s still the beginning of electronic music, what’s happening.
Torsten Schmidt
Something that’s sometimes, I feel, overlooked when we talk about the history
of synthesis, we’re mostly talking about warm sound and getting that original
sound and that sort of stuff. But what strikes you most when you get in touch
with these units for the first time, they do actually have an inherent rhythm
within them. A lot of the sounds do provide you with some rhythmic elements
straight away, if you apply some sort of modulation to an oscillator.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
What’s the opposite of no rhythm?
Torsten Schmidt
Silence, maybe? But the interesting thing is most people would go, “I want to
get that sound,” a single-hit note, a one-shot note. But most synthesized
sounds do have a lot of movement within them, and the beauty of using analog
equipment is you can manipulate the very parameters of that rhythm a lot more
directly than you can on a computer screen.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Do you think that’s true?
Jono Podmore
I think that’s true, I’d agree with you. The thing I find out about the
AKS and VCS-3 is that all the
parameters are out there for you to touch immediately. When you’re using a
mouse or a trackpad, you can only use one parameter at a time. You’ve got much
more access to more parts of the machine, and you can play with any number of
them simultaneously. It’s much more difficult with the current state of the
digital equipment.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I think you’re right, I think it is. David Cockerell, who you’ve seen a lot in
those pictures, I wanted him to make an implant into my arm, which in those
days — this was a long time ago — would purely control a voltage-controlled
oscillator. I thought I’d be able to think “high note,” and out would come a high
note. There’s no reason why not, absolutely none. You could train your arm,
but I couldn’t find a doctor to do it [laughter]. That’s true, he designed
the thing.
Jono Podmore
Maybe you could put it in the whippet? 
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Maybe, but I think what you’re saying is right. It would be much better to
have a multi-sensory input, in which case you don’t need to have the physical
thing because we’ve only got two hands and five fingers on each. It would be
much better — and I’m not joking here — to have direct thought to computer
control.
Torsten Schmidt
I’m sure you’re pretty aware of this, but there have been lots of experiments
on this in the last 30 or 40 years, and they found that the
currents used in the brain are just too low, so the amplitude wouldn’t be big
enough for the pick-ups to recognize the differences, so far, at least.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, that’s direct brain rhythm, but I’m not talking about that, I’m talking
about muscular.
Torsten Schmidt
So, you’re consciously controlling some part of the body?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Your thought controls it. You learn it, you can learn to control this muscle.
You only have to have the slightest change of voltage to have the highest and
lowest frequencies. And you can have several of these, just as you can move
different fingers.
Torsten Schmidt
But would the advantage be that big? The brain information going into making
the finger turn something.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
You’d be able to turn 100 [laughter].
Torsten Schmidt
Do we have a scientist in the house? Can we work on this one now?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I think so. Anyway, we can’t forecast. This is 200 years ago, what I’m talking
about. In the same way as this is 200 years ago, what I’m talking about here,
in another 200 years, say 2015, or whatever acceleration is.
Torsten Schmidt
So, you’re basically suggesting we all go out with neuro-scientists and get
some Intel...
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Is there anybody here who’d be up for such experiments?
Audience member 
Ray Kurzweil, I’m sure you’re
familiar with his work, he’s talking about the same thing with the scanning of
the brain and the wifi connecting to the synthesizer via the chip in your
head. It seems like an idea that a lot of people are talking about. I don’t
have a question.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I don’t want it in my head, I want it somewhere else. My nose perhaps. I do
think that computer music is only at the beginning. It’s made huge advances from
the first Music 5 programs, which were the first computer synthesis
programs. It’s advancing all the time. I think it’s going through a rather
static phase at the moment, it’s producing these programs to produce these polished nuggets of sound without enough scope for wild experiments. That’s my feeling, I might not be right. But who’s inventing completely new programs that don’t use MIDI, say? York University is one.
Audience member 
Is Trevor Wishart still at York University? Is that who you work with?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, I don’t. This sculpture, which I showed you, is financed by Morning Line,
they financed a whole new research department for several million pounds at
York University under Tony Myatt. It’s an annex to it, it’s got fantastic facilities, very good
recording studios, state of the art in Britain.
Audience member
You’ll have to excuse me, I’m going to gush for a minute. I found your mapping
of the libretto extremely freaky, because when I was a kid trying to figure out
how to produce, I noticed all my favorite tracks on records were all number
seven. I figured there needed to be a reason for that so I listened to the
records with the Cartesian plane and time. The Y value would always be if it’s
a rock record, how much does it rock? If it’s a soul record, how soulful is
it? I came up with the exact same curve in some of the best albums of all
time. In later years, I was doing film school and learning about classical
story structure and it’s the exact same curve. Freaky shit.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Number seven is 777, the Aleister
Crowley book. Seven is the
magic number of all magic numbers, so it doesn’t surprise me [laughter].
Audience member 
Anyway, my question — or my first of many questions, we’ll see how much time
there is — is in my experiments of trying to impose this curve upon my music,
writing, cooking, whatever, you don’t come up with the perfect album. There’s
something to be said for this non-quantifiable thing. You have perfect albums
that don’t adhere to this perfect curve. But how do you cater for the
unquantifiable thing that makes it beautiful?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Inspiration. I think that comes back to my Geiger counter and the luminous
watch and random numbers. It’s very, very important to tame randomness.
Although there’s a randomness, you tame it in the direction you want it, so there is the
unexpected. This is what inspiration is, taming the unexpected and the
unexpected can only come from randomness.
Audience member
So, when you’re composing or writing, how do you introduce randomness?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I suppose, just allow it to. A poet would surely say there’s a random element
to what comes to him on paper. Every word can’t be preordained by himself. It
must be, “There’s a good idea, so where does that good idea come from?” Maybe
the sunshine, or in my case, the rising tide. The tides moving up and
down were an incredibly good inspiration for this pattern. That’s fluke, that
is a randomness. You have to let yourself be open to these things, to let them
come in.
Jono Podmore 
One of the points we were talking about early on, one of the reasons why the
synthesizers like the Synthi A are becoming popular again these days is
because of their analog nature, there is a degree of randomness in there.
They behave. But when you put your right number in your right box of a digital
piece of software that you’re running on your computer, it just does exactly
that. The slightly random nature of the little bit of grit in the carbon track
is where that little bit of inspiration comes from for people who’ve grown up
completely working in the digital domain.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, you’re right. But in my new life doing electronic music again — my very
lucky new life, because I wasn’t doing it until a few years ago — now I find
using real sounds is where the randomness comes in. In those bits I played
you, each of those samples is a different sample so it varies the randomness.
The trouble is, I feel with synthesizers I know the sound, so it’s too
repetitive for me. Whereas the gigantic sound of an orchestra, no two pieces of music
by live performers are ever the same, is it? You take a piece of sheet music
and there are no two performances of it ever in history that are identical. So
this translation from a score or an idea is completely amazing. I think what
you were talking about is that the essence of music is that there’s always
something unexpected. And what you were saying about the randomness... No
vibrato on a violin is ever the same as the previous one.
Audience member
Another thing that’s been freaky for me is that I’ve also done similar experiments. I
had a little G2M audio to MIDI converter
box, it’s meant for playing
monophonic guitar lines. I would put random found sounds into it and see what
my synthesizer would play. It was just rubbish, but now there’s a company
called Melodyne that allows you be able to sample a chord and break it down into its parts.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
You can already with Melodyne
2. They’re just producing the
new version, Melodyne 3, but with Melodyne 2 you can do that already. That
allows you to shift or move the chords and stretch them apart, it’s an amazing
program. But I’m amazed by that example I showed you of a Beethoven being
transformed into recognizable — I can’t remember what — it was Tubular
Bells, I chose. But it’s still
recognizable as Beethoven, although it’s waveform to MIDI. It’s completely
extraordinary.
Torsten Schmidt
I think there is a question over here.
Audience member 
Sorry, I’m just going to jump in quickly. It seems we’re talking about the
sounds of synthesizers and the kind of randomness in sound that we all really
seek after from the older gear because we like that character. We touched on
the MIDI thing, converting actual audio to MIDI. Do you foresee a time when
you can digitize the sound of an instrument? I think a lot of the old
experiments, when you hear the
Mellotron choir and stuff, that was
the closest we ever got to a pleasing sound converted to the electronic thing.
But now MIDI signals seem so far away from the actual feeling of real
instruments.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I’ve had a lot of lovely pianos in my life and I’ve now got a Yamaha CLP-170 and it’s got a Steinway sampled piano, which it plays back. It’s a lovely, lovely piano. I can control it by MIDI and out comes this synthetic but sampled real piano and it’s a lovely sound. You’d be
hard pushed to say this wasn’t a piano. The same with new Sibelius orchestra
sounds, they’re very good in the new version of instrumental sounds,
especially the sampled ones. So, you can get real sounds and this will improve.
The actual amount of gigabytes you need for the samples is so large. When
space becomes faster and memory even better than now, it won’t matter how big
the samples are and you’ll be able to synthesize very realistic sounds. Does
anyone agree?
Audience member 
That was kind of where I was going with that. The computer is always going to
be “x” amount of numbers, no matter how high you set the parameters, that’s the
beauty of the early synthesizers that we all love. Even though you’re creating
an electronic sound, there’s always that beauty of the randomness and
something you can’t put your finger on. Is there ever going to be a point in
time where a computer can do that?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
If you think that your head is in a way a computer, when you listen to sounds
in your head, do you hear them differently each time?
Audience member 
Probably.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
So, the answer is yes.
Audience member 
You were giving us the example of when you used an image to transform it into
a score on Sibelius. We’ve been talking about randomness and the importance of
randomness in music, but how do you balance randomness and order? How do you
suggest we use the devices? You gave the example of the score. So, OK, I have
the score based on the image, how do I make it into a piece of work of my own
from that point?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, I hope that you’re going to tell me [laughs]. That’s what we’re all on
about, that’s what we want to do. There isn’t an answer to your question,
there are a million ways of doing it. It would be wonderful if I could say, “You want that secret? I’ll give you this piece of paper.” I would love to
have such a piece of paper.
Audience member
I have another question, it’s a bit technical. You mentioned the Geiger
counter. The algorithms being used back then are still more or less the same,
still ring-based. How exactly would you insert the random numbers from the
Geiger counter?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
You’d have to have a sampler that would sample the number of clicks given off
a Geiger counter, and from that you derive a number. Then you’d have a list of
numbers, an ever-generating list of numbers. Then you’d contain those numbers
in whatever way you like.
Audience member
And the sequence repeats itself…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, the sequence would never repeat, it would always be coming out, forever.
Audience member
Because you are constantly using a different…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Right. It comes out all the time so you would have a USB Geiger counter and
out come some random numbers. Then with just easy mathematics you can choose
what to do with those numbers.
Audience member
Then you use a modulo and the
remainder?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This was a big device in 1960. Now it would be very easy to do it. I don’t
think anyone’s made one, but it would be nice to have a little USB plug like
this.
Audience member
I think there is, they use it on online casinos to generate sequences.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Oh, you can get the sequences, I’m sure, but it would nice to have them self-
contained so they’re your own sequences, not from somebody else. Because, if
you can get it online, someone else can use that sequence, so it’s no longer
random.
Audience member
It’s never totally random, but for your purpose it’s…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
But if there were 20 of us, we’d have the same.
Audience member
Ah, yes. True, OK.
Torsten Schmidt
There’s a question over there, and there’s one over there as well. So, can we
somehow match Geiger counters and our personal DNA and somehow be totally
independent [laughs]?
Audience member
I read about the Morning
Line about a month before
coming here. Isn’t it a collaboration installation with various artists from
Spain?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, there are five composers who did it in Seville, where it opened. Now there
are another five doing it Istanbul.
Audience member
So, they’re a doing a different version in Istanbul?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, it’s a fantastic extravagance. This sculpture costs £100,000 to be
refurbished. It costs £100,000 to be refurbished, and it costs £100,000 to move. It must have moved now from Seville to Northampton in Britain to be recovered and rewired and refurbished. Then it costs £100,000 to send it to Istanbul; in Istanbul it will last for a few
months. Then it will cost £100,000 to send it to wherever, with another lot of
composers. It’s one of the most extravagant, wild, artistic gestures that has ever been done.
Audience member
I read a bit about it and heard it has a lot to do with randomness and
especially fractals in nature, the actual sculpture. There was this one artist
who really interests me, Roc Jiménez de
Cisneros, from Spain, Barcelona.
He’s doing some really interesting electronic music recording the gas horns at
York University, maybe you’ve heard of him? It’s weird, he’s doing electronic
compositions dealing with a lot of randomness, but replicating that same
randomness in a totally non-synthesized way, just doing gas horns and physical
[instruments]. Like, how would you do with a synthesizer, only in the physical
realm? So, do you believe that’s a tendency in post-electronic music that’s not
actually electronic, using organic means to make different sounds that we
probably heard in nature, but not really? Do you believe that’s a tendency?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yes, but immediately it’s recorded it’s like samples, so it is electronic.
Audience member
Yeah, but it doesn’t have to be recorded, it’s just replicated. He does it
live, the performances, but yeah, there are some MP3s floating around. But
you’re right about that.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
You don’t have the lion and the birds unless you’ve recoded them, it would be
difficult to have them there and then. Originally, this sculpture was going to
come this year to the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, and this is why it’s
this shape. But the South Bank decided it would be too difficult to put
wheelchair access to it so they refused it, which is why it’s going to
Istanbul.
Audience member
I’ve got another question. All of the digital workstations that we use these
days are very western, in the sense that it is all left to right, just how we write in the western
world. Do you think there’ll be a backlash towards that?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I do hope so because it’s terrible, they all look alike, it’s all very
similar. One person will say it’s like Apple versus PC, I use one, I use the
other. It would be marvelous if there was a revolution in that, so there was a
different concept of a score going from left to right like that.
Audience member
Yes, I believe a lot of our young artists, me included, are just putting all
our ideas into these programs. You have to learn how to use a program
instead of just letting ideas flow.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I agree with you. A spherical interface would be more ideal, something more
tactile. Coming back to this, but as an interface for a computer thing, those
linear doors are very, very frustrating, really.
Audience member
Yes, I can’t even work with structure, it’s really hard for me.
Torsten Schmidt
Aren’t you using Ableton anyway?
Audience member
Yeah.
Torsten Schmidt
But then you’re going to a different dimension straight away, aren’t you?
Audience member
Yeah, you can do it vertically, but I don’t really know how to structure
stuff. Maybe because I come from a different background of non-pop music.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Perhaps if there were a different scale, you could see the whole thing in a
different three-dimensional way and use that. I think it needs a revolution.
Why don’t you write a program? Seriously.
Audience member
I’m not really good at coding. I’ve been trying to learn programming for a
while now but it baffles me, too abstract.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
You need a David Cockerell in your field. You have a concept and you need
someone to screw it up, as it were.
Torsten Schmidt
We can put it online with this lecture now. You’ve got your request, just put
your email address on the stream.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
That’s exactly what happened to me, with some of the interviews in this, which
were for an Australian film called What The Future Sounded
Like. At the end of it I said I
wish I could find someone to work with. Immediately, this Morning Line thing
came up and the York University thing came up for me, just because of this
film. Broadcast it and you’ll find people will come and help you.
Torsten Schmidt
What email address should we put in there?
Audience member
Please contact moises_h@hotmail.com.
Torsten Schmidt
That’s the deal.
Audience member
I can’t pay you, I can give you some beer, maybe [laughter].
Audience member
Have you, by any chance, read a book called Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I have, a long time ago.
Audience member
I was looking at it the other day, and there’s this concept about classic
thought versus romantic thought. And classic is very much the underlying form,
how this thing really works, getting into the nitty gritty and breaking it all
down, all the parts you can get. The romantic side is just “It sounds good, cool,” essentially. I don’t know if you covered this in your chaos-versus-
order thing in randomness, but you obviously have a brilliant mind and you
were able to invent a language and get into synthesis, that’s pretty amazing.
But how do you translate the music you make from all the knowledge that you
have into something that can have a sense of beauty?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I don’t know, no idea [laughter].
Audience member
OK.
Torsten Schmidt
It’s probably one of the best lessons, to know when to say, “I don’t know.”
Jono Podmore 
There is an interesting point that our friend touched on earlier, saying he
doesn’t come from a popular music background, so his approach to the
sequencers or whatever is different. One of the reasons you’re appreciated by
this crowd is that your work has had a massive influence in popular culture rather
than high-art, academic, university culture. For what you’re working on now,
can you see how that would have an influence on popular culture, on commercial
culture?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
No, it’s really just a fluke that at my age I’ve got the opportunity to be
trying out these new techniques again with the knowledge of what it used to be
like. Therefore, in a way, I have an advantage of being able to jump in and
not care. Only if I can gather people like that together…
Audience member
Well, you’ve got his email address now [laughs].
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I haven’t, he must give it to me. [To participant] Will you give me your
email address, write it down? It’s people like him, who have to think how best
to revolutionize the state of play at the moment. That’s what people like
David Cockerell did, to say, “Yes, I can do that out of a concept.”
Jono Podmore 
But do you feel that is something that remains in academic culture or has a
much greater repercussions in popular culture?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I think it must be popular culture. As you said, so many people are able to
synthesize music. But, in a way, it’s like saying a lot of people have a good
piano, but it doesn’t mean there’s a lot of good pianists. The piano is very
clever in that it’s got a wonderful format, so you can use all your fingers
and all sorts of things. It’s a wonderful format. I don’t think there’s yet
this wonderful format for making inventive electronic music. That’s what you
were saying, isn’t it? That there isn’t such a wonderful device for
controlling your thoughts into it.
Audience member
My question was about improvisation as an electronic musician, but I guess,
that’s the answer: You’re programming, you’re not performing.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
That’s why I showed you those scores at the beginning that has these grand ideas: Surprise,
tension, greyness, dependency on what’s happening — these are the notions of
inspiration to a music school. It hasn’t been done yet, but it will.
Audience member
Do you think, if you had complete control, going back to what Moises was
saying, and a different way of approaching electronic music that you would be
able to express yourself like a concert pianist obviously can, but in the
electronic realm?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Perhaps you could, or my great-grandchildren, but I couldn’t, no.
Audience member
Do you think that’s the next level of improvisational electronic music?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It must be, but it depends on having a good input device, which is subtler
than a mouse and a keyboard.
Audience member
That’s terrible.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Terrible [laughs].
Audience member
[inaudible]
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Well, they’re monosyllabic in a way, aren’t they?
Audience member
There are already multi-touch controllers.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
This magazine I mentioned, Source, if you can look in your music libraries,
this wonderful extravagant magazine. Thick, with records in them. One of them
is a page with different materials and animal furs and you touch it, you touch
the different things and you think music, it’s a music score. This is
brilliant. You close your eyes and touch different things and this is the
score, so you have a page laid out with these things to touch. That’s what I
mean. How do you use these different tactile things to make what our friend
wants? A good input programmer. Maybe. But that’s for you to do.
Audience member
What about the use of motion capture?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
What about it?
Audience member
You put markers on your arms and with the infra-red cameras you can take the
movement that you make and then translate that movement into MIDI messages
that could go to images and to sound.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Yeah, but it would be the language. Alright, you’ve got a hundred mice and
you’re a good dancer and you’ve got 20 infra-red cameras and you’ve got this
mass of information there, but that doesn’t mean that, because you’ve got this
mass of movement information that you make good music. What is the translation
between one and the other?
Audience member
I just thought instead of using implants motion capture could be like…
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
It sounds wonderful, I’d love to hear your piece and see it because it would
be visual as well.
Torsten Schmidt
There’s another one over there and then, I guess, what we’ll do is break it up
and for those who are interested give a little demo of the unit, and the rest
of you will be relieved for your lunch break.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
“Released” [laughs].
Torsten Schmidt
I can see this total division between people who are absolutely into it and
the others who are like, “What planet are we on right now?”
Audience member
Sorry, to keep bringing it back to this corner, but in terms of the things
we’ve just touched on, different controllers, giving you more control over a
variety of different sounds, do you still think if you had a different
controller, an implant or motion capture or whatever, how would you make it so
you had complete control over the sounds and you weren’t still confined by the
bounds by the control, say, of western harmony?
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
I have to return the question – it’s up to you. I’ve got no idea how you would
do that. How could I possibly know? These are unknown techniques to me. The
future is in your hands, boy, as they say in Scotland [laughter].
Audience member
Well, maybe you heard it all here first.
Dr Peter Zinovieff 
Good luck.
Torsten Schmidt
I guess, that’s probably the perfect ending. The future is in all your hands,
and join me in thanking Dr Peter Zinovieff.
[applause]
