Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So won’t you please welcome Madlib. Welcome to New York. How often do you get here actually? Does it still have any kind of ... I know you’ve traveled the world. Does New York have a special place for you at all anymore? You’ve seen so many places.
Madlib
I love New York man. I mean all the producers who came from here. I grew up on all that type of shit. Large Professor ... A lot of people.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you remember the first time you came here as sort of a young artist even, just sort of paying your dues, coming through here in New York?
Madlib
I did Bobbito’s spot. That was one of the first shows I did ... Eyes closed the whole time ... Rapping with Lootpack and shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
A little case of the nerves?
Madlib
I just rap like that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What do you think of your sort of world travels as far as how that’s influenced you? You have all of these sort of Beat Konductor projects where you take on a different sound from a different part of the globe. What is it when you visit these places or just visit them through your music ... Through the records?
Madlib
It’s mainly through records because a lot of places I haven’t visited. But I get bored with music. You all know that already. I listen to all types of different things and try to find something good in every genre because it’s possible.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How did you first get hip to sounds from different places?
Madlib
Messing with my man Egon. We use to live in a house together ... Me, Wolf, Egon and Jeff Jank. We used to trade different records and music.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What was sort of the first part of the world that sort of captivated you?
Madlib
Brazil. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think that the last time you said you did one of these was in 2002 for RBMA?
Madlib
Yeah, I don’t talk in front of people. I don’t talk around my friends, we use sign language and shit. Me and Karriem Riggins.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
We’re simulcasting this on radio so the sign language thing will go over really well. 
Madlib
[laughs]
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
In 2002, I remember you guys, you, Egon, Cut Chemist, a bunch of other guys coming down. I guess you did a little bit of record shopping then?
Madlib
Yeah, that changed my life. I bought three boxes of records. First time I went out there actually... Two boxes didn’t make it back to the US.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What happened?
Madlib
They don’t know. Two boxes of rare joints.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
Maybe Egon has something to do with that. I don’t know. And you spent a lot of that time in your room actually working on beats and stuff too right?
Madlib
Still do. Nothing’s changed.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You’re originally from California of course. Oxnard.
Madlib
Yeah. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I’d like to revisit something not from your past because I know you don’t like to hear your own music. You just told me that.
Madlib
I don’t want to hear that shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
This is related to you. This is sort of ease us into this. Let’s listen to a little piece of this and you tell me what this is and maybe you can describe what it is for everybody. 
(music: Otis Jackson – Beggin’ For A Broken Heart / applause)
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So what was that?
Madlib
That’s my pops. I remember looking at that record and thinking I wanted to make records and stuff.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
This is from, what the ‘70s?
Madlib 
Yeah. 1974.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
This is a song that is kind of a rare soul recording ... Kind of a collectible thing. When did you kinda first become aware that, you know, your dad was doing … 
Madlib
My pops had me at the studio since I was born. That’s why I got into music. He always let me go up on the controls and just mess with stuff. Engineers get mad. “Let the brother do it!” Mess with stuff. That’s how I learned.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Was there a studio in the house?
Madlib
We had the tapes ... The old tape machines and things.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Your mother was also down with the music in some capacity? Your mother was also doing music?
Madlib
Yeah she wrote all his music.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, what was her …
Madlib
My mother was a pianist ... A crazy pianist. She wrote all his music and stuff.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What did it mean to you to grow up in a musical household, not just sort of learning stuff, I mean …
Madlib
I didn’t have to think about it. I’m strictly music, so it was just in me. I don’t think about it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Did you think about it in terms of just what you were doing as opposed to your friends as far as...
Madlib
No, I hung out with musicians too. I only hung out with dudes likeminded. Everybody thought I was crazy where I lived. Now everybody likes me over there.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Was it cool to you? It’s kind of one of these things where your parents put out records, were doing cool things. Did you think they were cool when you were a kid?
Madlib
Yes. Yes. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Straight up, you were like “my parents are cool.” 
Madlib
They bought all the equipment for me to do what I do, nah mean, early age.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
All right good. I am just sort of wondering, you have kids now. Do your kids think you’re cool?
Madlib
Nah. [pauses] Nah, I’m playing. Yeah, I’m the coolest in the world to my kids. Fo’ sho, fo’ sho. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When did your sort of get in trouble? I remember you telling me this once, you kind of got in trouble once with your pops, right? With equipment.
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What happened?
Madlib
He bought me and Oh No this studio that we work at. And we had a party one night. He was like, “Y’all can do whatever y’all do, but don’t sit at my table. Don’t sit at my chair.” We got weed all on the table, like girls upstairs like that [points to balcony]. Pops walked in. You know, you know what happened. He walked out and talked to me outside. It was all good. He understood because he lived that life, but oh well. I got my ass beat, but it was still cool.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What about when you were trying out his equipment? I feel like you had some experiments with the styluses and had to make up your own. What happened with that?
Madlib
I use to put little pins under the shit so you can just hear it without speakers or whatever. You just hear the music on the record. I still have those records. They’re all fucked up.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You put a pin instead of a record player needle?
Madlib
Yes sir.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, it makes sense.
Madlib
I had to hear the music. That’s the only way I could hear the music.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Let me ask you this. So Oh No is your brother, right?
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What’s your brother’s government name?
Madlib
He don’t like that name. His government name is… Ooooh! Michael Jackson.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What was it like having a brother named Michael Jackson growing up?
Madlib
He was cool. I ain’t worry about no names. We’re kind of the same so we got along.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What was the first thing that drew you to music then that you heard that was really inspiring to you? Was it your dad’s records or was it just stuff you played?
Madlib
As far as hip-hop, “Rapper’s Delight”, I ain’t gon’ front. “Rapper’s Delight” was the first song I heard where I was like “oh take that beat and do something over it.” So I started collecting records after that ... Old records.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
But at the time, I hate to make these generalizations in terms of east coast versus west coast, but I mean were you cognizant that some of the records you were into were coming from New York versus hip-hop from the Bay?
Madlib
Yeah but I don’t think about it. Other people thought about it. When I was playing all that stuff, I just like what I like and that’s that. I mean, they are sampling records that were recording in the west coast or it don’t really matter. I just like good music, that’s all.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What were some of the artists and records that inspired you besides “Rapper’s Delight”, after that?
Madlib
As far as hip-hop?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
Marley Marl productions, Paul C, rest in peace, DJ Pooh from the west coast, Dr. Dre ... The old Dr. Dre type stuff where he was sampling breaks and shit ... All that type of stuff.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Were you aware of what sampling was at that time? Did you have an idea of what they were doing?
Madlib
Yeah, yeah, I was sampling when I was in junior high, me and DJ Romes. DJ Romes gave me my first sampler ... The little Casio joint.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay.
Madlib
I walked far to just to go borrow that shit, just to borrow it for a day and make a beat tape or whatever.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Just to sort of set the stage as far as the era goes, how did you find out about music? How did you ... I mean there was no Internet obviously. There was no MTV Raps yet. How did you find out about stuff?
Madlib
Record shops. I was always in record stores. My pops had a bunch of records too. That’s my first crate ... My pop’s crate was my first crate. And that was in the crate actually [points to record].
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Oh okay. I did a little research here, let me see if I can play a piece.
Madlib
That was one of my first records I had.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay. Let me see if this plays. What would this be? 
(music: The JBs – You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I’ll Be Straight / applause)
You’re a kid. You’re hearing this, this here and the JBs, stuff like this. What’s going through your mind at the time?
Madlib
Just funky. I was into funky shit. Ohio Players, JBs, all that type stuff ... just funky shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
As far as the first crew goes, you mentioned Romes. Was it a feeling that if you were into hip hop at the time it was not the thing that everybody else was into yet or was it, you know. 
 Madlib
Yeah. From where I’m from, dudes was shooting and gang banging so … I was looking weird with a clock on my shit and a Bobcat hat, all that type of shit. I was following Public Enemy all that type of stuff
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You just mentioned the gang activity. What was going on at Oxnard at the time?
Madlib
Just Mexican and black crime. Black on black and Mexicans shooting each other.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Were your parents concerned about what was happening in the streets?
Madlib
Nah, I ain’t into that shit, I just do music, stay in my room, that’s about it. Trynna live.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I know we’re going a little bit biographical here but I just wanted to get an idea of when you met Wolf. How did you guys get on? How did you decide that … 
Madlib
Man, fuck Wolf. That’s all.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay.
Madlib
I’m playing, that’s my homie. [laughs] That’s my homie. He set it up. That’s why I’m doing what I’m doing now. [laughs] We used to live together, we all used to...
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You’ve talked about that time as pretty special. 
Madlib
Yeah, yeah. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Thinking back, what are some of things that kinda stand out to you - 
Madlib
He just allowed me to do what I wanna do. He paid for ... I’d rent vibraphones and all types of instruments and things and he was like, “Yeah, let’s do it, let’s do it.” Anything I said I wanted to do, he was with it. So I just had that freedom. I didn’t have the money, he had the money. I had...
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You mentioned the instruments but what sort of stuff were you guys accumulating?
Madlib
Ahh man. I was doing jazz stuff, I started out doing hip hop stuff with him and I was like, “I just want to do jazz stuff.” And I just started renting instruments and he was with it. He didn’t understand at first but ...
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How long did it take for him to see a vision of what was going on?
Madlib
When I said I wanted to do it he was like, “Okay, do it.” I just did it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When you sit down and you ... because you still obviously do the jazz stuff. Yesterday’s New Quintet, all of these different musicians under whose names these projects come out. What’s the process like? What’s your ... when you sit down, how does it start? What do you usually start with?
Madlib
It used to be I just try to replay the records that I liked. I just listen to the record and then filter the bassline out and then just play over that and then keep adding things and adding things. Then I learned to write music and how I do it different.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
And how long did it take you to build it, one particular track usually?
Madlib
I was good from the start. I’m not a soloist but I can put things together and make something.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
One of the things, especially with jazz, but I guess any instrumental music, is always an interaction between the players but you’re the only player, so how do you …
Madlib
That’s what you think. You can do ... it can go anywhere. People think it has to be one way but you can do it however you do it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I’m saying, how are you able to ... it’s amazing. How are you able to play off something that you’re not necessarily hearing yet?
Madlib
You know what? I don’t even think about it. I just do it. That’s the problem, I can’t articulate. I don’t think about it, I just do it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Let’s say for example, you’re gonna sit down and you’re gonna ... this is a day you’re gonna create some music. What’s the typical …
Madlib
Everyday.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So let’s say it’s a typical day, what might it be like if you were going to walk us through it. What would that day be like?
Madlib
My day has no start because I don’t really sleep too much. I may sleep … 2 hours a night and them 2 hours might be at 3 p.m. or ... it’s always different, so I’m just creating music constantly.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Is that in the studio or at home or both?
Madlib
It’s at home and the studio.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How is it with the kids and working, making music at home?
Madlib
I just put them headphones on and give them the iPad and I do what I do. iPad is the greatest thing as far as kids. Whooo, thank you. Thank you, Steve.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I can’t even make a phone call or send an email when my kids are around.
Madlib
Yeah, they be running round but I just shut off for some reason. Smoke some weed, shut off.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When …
Madlib
They know I do music so they don’t mess with me too much. They cool with it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Are they curious at all yet?
Madlib
Yeah. They like, “Buy some speakers.” I’m always doing shit in headphones but like, ‘“Just buy some speakers so we can hear what you’re doing.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do they prefer the sample stuff or the live stuff or what’s their ... do they have any differentiation between. 
Madlib
I have no idea. Favorite thing they like is Jaylib shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Really?
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Interesting.
Madlib
I know. I’m lucky.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Not the Quas stuff yet? Are they down with Quas?
Madlib
Oh yeah. They love Quas.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The high voices ...
Madlib
Messed up all my dolls. Wrote on ‘em and shit. I was collecting ‘em but …
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The Quasimoto dolls?
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What do they do with Quasi-
Madlib
I brought ‘em home to just put up to collect. Shit’s got writing all over ‘em. Arm missing. Kids.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Now you’ve talked about Quasimoto as far as your idea of how it came about. Can you just, for the sake of refreshing people’s memory, can you give us a quick …
Madlib
It came about because I don’t like my voice when I rap. They said I sound like [puts on deep voice] Barry White. So I had to do something to make it sound where I like it. I don’t like my regular voice so I just had to zone out in many ways. I don’t advise this but I took some shrooms and just bugged out and just tried to think of something different and that shit came about. But I never intended to put it out, I just did it for me to just listen to. I do a lot of stuff just for me to listen to.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So did Wolf hear it or Egon heard it?
Madlib
Wolf heard it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What did he say to you?
Madlib
“Let’s make some money. A little bit of money.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That says a lot about these guys too, that they would hear that and think that, “Okay, we’re gonna” …
Madlib
I know. I was like, “With that? Really? Okay.” And best selling record. One of them.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
One of them. I’m just kind of curious because I always wondered, obviously that’s the inception of this idea from your own experience but did you ever listen to Prince’s stuff and listen to how he did stuff with the voices? Did that have any play in it?
Madlib
It’s plenty of artists before all of us that did that in like the ‘50s, ‘60s. ‘50s and ‘60s and ‘70s. Lot of artists. A lot. I didn’t start nuttin’. Prince didn’t start nuttin’. It was already happening.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Just while we’re on the topic real quick ...
Madlib
Rest in Peace.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Rest in Peace, obviously. Have you been going through your Prince music just since the last week and a half, just going back at all?
Madlib
Yeah, for sure. Tried to make a little tribute beat tape that I just made for myself. Crazy stuff. I love Prince.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Which albums or which tracks had been your favorites? I’m just wondering.
Madlib
The early stuff. ‘89 and before. That’s just me though.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well, a lot of us.
Madlib
“Ballad of Dorothy Parker”. “Lady Cab Driver”. Controversy album. All that type stuff. “Let’s Work”.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Absolutely. When you made your beat tape, did you sample Prince’s stuff or ...
Madlib
Yeah, it’s all Prince shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay. You can slide that to me later if you want.
Madlib
[laughs] Yeah. You can have it. [laughs]
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you think of yourself as one of these guys who’s keeping sample-based music alive? People like to peg you that way.
Madlib
I started out doing that and that’s just what I’m doing. Regardless of who’s suing me or who ... whatever. That’s what I grew up on, that’s what Imma do. I also make music too so it doesn’t really matter.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What do you think the appeal is of sampling? I love it as a listener - 
Madlib
For me I just like that certain vibe from the ‘60s, ‘70s, and the ‘80s. That’s all it is. I like a certain sound and that’s what I deal with, that’s what I grew up on so … Everybody don’t have to like it but that’s just what I do.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
It’s like you said, it’s suggested. I’m sure it’s caused you some headaches too.
Madlib
Yeah but it’s hard to sample and it’s hard to make music so it doesn’t really matter. As long as you try to do both, it really don’t matter. They try to act like sampling is not music but it’s hard to do correctly.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Let’s play a little something real quick. Let me see, how do we wanna do this? Should we play this one or should we play the track? Give me some feedback. 
Madlib
I don’t wanna hear either. [laughs]
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So I’m going to do this against your wishes. Let’s hear a little something just to give us a frame of reference for some of the stuff that you’ve worked on. 
(music: Kanye West ft. Kendrick Lamar – No More Parties In L.A. / applause)(music: Junie Morrison – Suzie Thudertussy / applause)
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
All right, so you were making some motions while we were listening to that. Just what was going through your mind hearing this again, just in terms of what you did with this?
Madlib
I just wanted to leave it the same. Dudes get mad. [puts on voice] “Dude’s just looped that shit up.” That’s my sound. I’m a loop digger, so I just want to leave it like that, just make it dirtier than what it was. People don’t really ... Some people don’t really understand that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, but I think you’re being a little bit modest here too, because that’s not just looping. I mean...
Madlib
I chopped it, but I’m saying … 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
I’m the Loopdigga, so whatchu expect, man?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
Go listen to that if you want to hear that man.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What I love about what you do is there are these little chops, like you just mentioned, sort of intermingling with the rest of the loop. Plenty of people do this and do it well but … is there an internal rhythm that’s in your head, as far as where you decide to place things? I know you don’t -
Madlib
It’s natural. If you sit there and think about it too much, your shit probably whack. You just have to be natural and … the roots of the shit, you just do it and that’s that. You sit there and polish your shit for a week, I don’t know about all that shit. That’s cool for you all, but I don’t know about all that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you feel like ... This is Junie Morrison, by the way, which is …
Madlib
Respect to Junie Morrison.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, he was one of the …
Madlib
Parliament-Funkadelic.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Ohio Players.
Madlib
Yes, Dam-Funk.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. You hear this track, to me, and you’re able to hear something ... What I like about the No More Parties track, obviously, you’re taking a loop, but then there’s also, when he sings ‘Lost in Los Angeles’, basically the story of the song is somebody who meets a groupie, figures out that that person actually meant something to him later. There is this emotion behind it. Do you think at all, even about the emotion of the songs that you sample, what’s in them? How much do you listen to them?
Madlib
It’s all emotion. I don’t really think too much. It’s just emotion … I don’t think about it. That’s the problem. I’m just ... I’m my dad’s son so I just ... It’s music.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Ok. So you’ve said in the past that …
Madlib
I actually did ... every time I sample a record, I do the whole record. I sample off the whole record.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, different pieces you mean?
Madlib
No, I mean I make beats off the whole record.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, what do you mean?
Madlib
They just pick that beat.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Oh, you mean ... Well, explain it to me. What do you mean? Do you mean you …
Madlib
When I sample a record, I usually make beats out the whole record while it’s right there.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The whole album?
Madlib
Yeah. Every best piece of the record and just move on after that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So there might be more tracks than …
Madlib
Oh I got ... Yeah, I got like ten …
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Just off …
Madlib
Yeah. That don’t mean it’s going to come out. It just means I did that. I do that. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
As a form of practice or as just something to...
Madlib
Just shit I want to hear.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Now, when you sit in a session you said that this is kind of a meditative thing for you. Is it meditation for you?
Madlib
Yeah. I shut off from the world. It’s just something you can’t try to do. It’s just something that happens. That’s my life. It’s a blessing and a curse because my time is spent doing that, but I also have a family and things.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well, thank god for the iPad then. 
Madlib
[laughs] Actually, that beat was made off a iPad.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay. Really?
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I remember seeing, and maybe other people saw this on social media, there was a picture of Kanye with the beat CDs and it was like, “Thanks for the beat CDs.” 
Madlib
He didn’t like them beats. [laughs] I’m just kidding Kanye... Sent him a bunch of crazy Quasimoto shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
I heard they was battling back and forth for a couple of hours over the beat CDs.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Ok. So you remember what’s on that beat CD?
Madlib
Oh, yeah. Six CDs.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Six CDs.
Madlib
Yeah, Gibbs took all of them. He rapped over everything. Kanye waited too long. Gibbs rapped over everything.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Basically, those beats CDs is what became Piñata, is what you’re saying?
Madlib
No, the new one.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The new one?
Madlib
The new Bandana joint. Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Oh, okay. So Freddie Gibbs, what is it about Gibbs that is …
Madlib
He’s a good rapper. He’s a good rapper. He’s like my cousin, we just get along. He might shoot you, might hug you. I don’t know.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When is the next record that you guys are working on? How close are you guys to it?
Madlib
Ain’t no telling. I did that with DOOM. There ain’t no telling. We have no idea. I’m not going to lie. We got tracks recorded, but that don’t mean they’re gon’ come out.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You’re cool with that?
Madlib
I got 20 tracks with DOOM. That don’t mean they’re gon’ come out. You know what I mean?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, but you’re cool with that, though? It seems like you have this Zen quality about you where it seems like it’s just whatever comes, comes and when it happens, it happens.
Madlib
My bad. Yep.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Now Madlib Invazion, since when? How long has Madlib Invazion been happening?
Madlib
Since I started making beats. As far as Madlib Invazion, but the record label it started five years ago or something like that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, around five, six years ago.
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What was important to you, as far as establishing that label, your own independent imprint?
Madlib
Just putting out stuff I want to hear and it has nothing to do with anybody else. Basically.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When you go through history of independent labels, I know you have great reverence for labels like Strata East, Tribe Records …
Madlib
Yeah. They didn’t do too well.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
They were artist-controlled endeavors.
Madlib
That’s what I’m all about.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
I’d rather have that than like… big paycheck. I get checks anyways, but I’d rather have that control.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you have ... When you and Egon are sitting down and figuring out where it’s going to go in terms of what the, for lack of a better word, a mission statement or something like that, is there any ... Do you think of it in terms of lineage, in terms of this history?
Madlib
Not really. I just do the music and some of it comes out. Stuff that I think should come out.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Tell us what is coming out on that imprint that you’re working on now?
Madlib
Let’s see ... I got that new Bandana album coming out with Gibbs. I got a producer series with different producers from around the world, like Oh No, Pete Rock, Gaslamp Killer, RJ from Slum Village, Evidence from Dilated Peoples … bunch of people. Young dudes that y’all don’t know about.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Let me play you something real quick from this group. I understand you’re a fan of this group and you may have collaborated with them a little. 
Madlib
Who is it? 
(music: Embryo – Far East / applause)
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What is that? That we just listened to?
Madlib
That’s my homies.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Who is that?
Madlib
From Germany. Embryo. ‘60s, ‘70s, rock, jazz band, psychedelic rock jazz, soul, everything.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What is about Embryo that caught you …
Madlib
They like all types of music and they put it all in one thing.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You spent some time with as well, working with them.
Madlib
Yeah, I got 10 hours of music recorded with them. I’m just on the drums. We all switched from instruments and we just bug out.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Where was this? When did this happen?
Madlib
Germany.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
In Germany. That’s just where the band is from, right?
Madlib
Five years ago. Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When you’re into that type of scenario, I don’t know, I’m not a musician, I’m not a producer …
Madlib
Oh, it was like looking, dudes is my idols. I dig for records and I mean these dudes are my idols and I’m in there playing with them and they’re just showing me what they went through and all that type of stuff. Drinking mad wine with them, smoking trees and … you know. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So Embryo, one of your musical heroes. Let’s go through a couple different things and just, you just get your own -
Madlib
They got mad styles, though. That’s just one style.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That album is interesting because I guess it’s ... I’m not that familiar with the group, to be honest. It’s kind of a far eastern style that they’re exploring. It’s a German band.
Madlib
They went to India and just sat with all the musicians and …
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
They’re also singing in English on that track too, so it’s just an amalgamation of a lot of different styles. Let’s listen to this and just give me what your impressions are. We’re just going to go through a couple different tunes and sit here and listen.
(music: Cesar Camargo Mariano – Metropole / applause)
Madlib
That sounds like “Chameleon”, Herbie Hancock.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
It does a little bit. Yeah.
Madlib
He’s trying to bite some shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That was Cesar Mariano, right?
Madlib
Married to?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You tell me.
Madlib
Elis Regina.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
For real?
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Oh, okay. He’s a Brazilian artist and a Brazilian record.
Madlib
Oh, yeah. Produced a lot of Brazilian artists, arranged the records and played on them too. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When you hear this, what goes through your mind, besides it’s funky?
Madlib
It just feels good. Me and Dilla used to bump that whole record. That’s just one little piece. You’ve got to hear the whole album. It’s good shit. Just listen to our loop …
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How often, when you guys hung out, was it just listening to records like this and stuff?
Madlib
We’d either be digging or listening to each other’s beats or record shopping or listening to each other’s beats or record shopping or listening to each other’s beats and that’s about it. Smoke, go to the club, go to the strip club, whatever.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I know people ask you about this all the time, but what do you think that ... What is your impression of Dilla as a person that maybe people don’t necessarily talk about enough?
Madlib
He’s a fellow alien. He’s a fellow alien. It’s hard to explain dude. Fellow alien. Musical cousin.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What’s the thing that.
Madlib
He was a king though. What I’m saying is we was still musical cousins.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What’s a thing that you think you took from being a friend of his? Just being a colleague of his?
Madlib
He’s a cool dude man, he’s a nice dude and we like the same type of music, which was probably all types of music. I give him a crate, he give me a crate and like … I gave him the loop for “Lightworks” and he gave me the loop for that … whatever man.
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
Let’s keep going and listen to a couple more things. This is something I would imagine is dear to your heart.
(music: Sun Ra – Mu / applause)
Madlib 
Sun Riza! Cosmic music.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Who was that?
Madlib
Sun Riza. Sun Ra, the king.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When we were listening to that you said a couple of things. What was your observation, what hit you?
Madlib
What I say?
Speaker RBMA:
You said, John Gilmore.
Madlib 
Oh, John Gilmore on the horn, king. John Coltrane used to study with him because he thought he was better than him. Nuff said.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
And the clavinet.
Madlib
That song is like from what, 1960 ... It’s the first use of the clavinet that I know. The clavinet electric keyboard. He was one of the first to use electric keyboards.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When you sit back and you listen to Sun Ra, I know you’re a huge Sun Ra head … was your dad playing Sun Rah back in the house, back in the day? When did you start getting into Sun Ra?
Madlib
Just buying records. I just buy weird covers, look at the cover and if it’s weird Imma buy it. Look at the instruments, basically.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Did you know stuff about the back story of him at that point.
Madlib
I didn’t know about Sun Ra until I saw a documentary on him in like ‘99 ... ‘98, something like that. And from there, I’m right there with him.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
In Space Is The Place, you saw the film and everything that was like a big … was that a big moment for you?
Madlib 
Yeah, because he was so huge musically. It’s like … every style. Every… not too many people did that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You mean just in terms of just the jazz stuff, the out stuff, the more groove orientated …
Madlib
And the way he lived. Outer space ways, you know.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Are you going to get a house with aluminum foil out front at some point?
Madlib
Imma just get fat like him, just kick it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That means you’re living well then. Let me play one more thing and ...
Madlib
Yeah, go buy some Sun Ra records.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
All right, I’m not sure if it’s this one or this one ... 
(music: ROB – Just One More Time / applause)
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you remember what this is? Who is this?
Madlib
It’s R-O-B, ROB, Funky Rob Way.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
This is what from …
Madlib
From Africa, I think that’s ... who’s that? 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Is it Nigerian or no?
Madlib
That’s ... What’s the dude who used to sing with Michael Jackson? Man, he’s the dad of a famous singer, what the fuck is his name?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
On this? He’s on this record?
Madlib
Akon, that’s Akon’s dad.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Akon’s dad is on this record?
Madlib
That’s Akon’s dad.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
For real?
Madlib
ROB, yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Wow.
Madlib
ROB is Akon’s dad.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
For real.
Madlib
How come he didn’t do that type of shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Wow, okay so were you hip … 
Madlib
I’m just playing.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Were you just an Akon fan and you... [laughs]
Madlib
Nah, Egon told me, from Now Again Records. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I mean, Egon’s obviously had a big ... You guys are friends going way back since the Stones Throw days. He’s obviously worked with you closely over all these years, I mean ...
Madlib
Man, fuck Egon. I’m just kidding, yeah that’s my brother right there.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
He hipped, he got you …
Madlib
That’s my brother, he looked out for me and …
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
He got you turned on to the wine game now and everything.
Madlib
Yeah, I ain’t drinking Ripple, I’m drinking that good … Champipple.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What’s the Champipple?
Madlib
Fred Sanford, champagne and Ripple mix, Champipple. Y’all don’t know about that?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What’s deeper, the wine game or the record game?
Madlib
That’s the same. It’s equal.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How so?
Madlib
It’s equal because it’s all deep. It’s always rare shit, all the time.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you feel like your wine game is on par with your record game?
Madlib
I’m still a minor. I’m not that great at it yet but I’m learning. I let him pick it out for me and I get the boxes sent to the crib.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, okay. You have … reputedly you have like four rooms of records right? Like four different rooms of records.
Madlib
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Are you going to have to buy a new house?
Madlib
I need like 10 rooms, that ain’t enough.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Are you going to have a wine wing then too, like for the wine?
Madlib
Yeah, if I make some money.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, we’ll work on it.
I was pulling something else and you grabbed this record.
Madlib
Yeah, it’s one of my favorite labels in the world, I just got hip to it like six years ago.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, now ...
Madlib
The best jazz label in the world.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Which label is this?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
From Italy. Horo records. They recorded all the American artists that America just was like, “Fuck y’all.” He took …  “Come on, make some money, do what you want to do.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What is this record? Do you remember?
Madlib
This is Stafford James, he played with Woody Shaw, he’s a bassist, and a bunch of people.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, so let’s take a quick listen to this …
Madlib
Dope ass beat right here.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Tell me what your impressions are when you hear it. 
(music: Stafford James – Costa Bruciata / applause)
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Why do you like the piano out of tune?
Madlib
Because I don’t like shit too perfect, I like a little ... I like some human mistake in my shit. If it’s too perfect I ain’t really with it, if it’s too clean I ain’t really with it, if it’s too polished I don’t really like it. That’s just me, that’s my ears.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Did anybody ever give you that feedback early in your career? In terms of the music you were making and how did that …
Madlib
People complaining all the time, I just do what I want to do regardless because it’s for my health so I don’t really care about what people say. I thank the people that like it but I don’t care about your criticism because I know what I’m doing, you don’t know what I’m doing so I don’t really care.
Speaker: Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah. Are you, not to get too technical, are you burning stuff onto cassette ... I remember in 2002 when you sat and you talked to us about this stuff. Everything was going to like a cassette and being mastered off of that. Have you embraced some technological change since then?
Madlib
My music sounds like that anyway, nah. I just do what I do. Let me be, let me do what I do and you can do your thing. That’s all. Imma be me. I’m going to be the last dude doing what I do.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, absolutely. I have a couple of questions that have been submitted through the …
Madlib
Aw shit. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
… magic of this thing called the internet.
Madlib 
Okay, what’s that?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
It’s this thing that, you know, you don’t have to worry about, thankfully.
Madlib
I don’t really fuck with it, I don’t really mess with it. I don’t have Twitter fingers, I don’t really do all that shit. Fighting online like you’re tough, I don’t do all that type shit. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Twitter fingers, I like that.
Madlib 
I don’t do that shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well, some people do have Twitter fingers and they have a couple of questions they want to ask you so I’m just going to read a couple before we take some questions from people in this room.
Madlib
Alrighty.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
@killian, I hope I’m pronouncing that correctly. Who’s your favorite Indian musician?
Madlib
R. D. Burman. R. D Burman.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
R. D. Burnman and for those of us who are not familiar with that person, what is it about …
Madlib
He gets funky and he stays traditional too. I like people that switch it up. You get bored if you don’t switch it up.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Instrumentalist or …
Madlib
Yeah, he’s an instrumentalist, he’s an arranger, all that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, okay. And how’d you get hip to him?
Madlib
Probably Egon, actually.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, yeah. How did you get your records from India then, usually? Did you see individual sellers?
Madlib
They got records in L. A. I went to Germany and went to this spot called Demonfuzz and they had like four boxes, I bought them all. I haven’t been to India yet. They probably ain’t even got the records out there.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, perhaps not. Are you planning to go to India at some point?
Madlib
Nah, not. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Just cool with the records?
Madlib
I mean, I would love to, I love the food, and the people.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, next question is from @goddamnchan, peace to goddamnchan. What’s some advice you were given along the way that has stuck out and really helped you?
Madlib
Do your taxes. Straight up.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Who had that piece of advice for you?
Madlib
Who was that? I think it was Broadway from L.A. Broadway used to produce for Loud Records and stuff.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay. That’s an excellent piece of advice right there.
Madlib
People still don’t do it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, yeah. Why do you think that is?
Madlib
I think they just ... do your taxes, man. It’s hassle, you know what I mean?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Next question, from @djbobsacamento, I don’t know if this is supposed to be Sacramento or sacamento but what is your favorite J Dilla memory?
Madlib
Just first meeting him and the acknowledgment he gave me. I was trying to tell him what he was but he was just … telling me “I love your music!” I was like ‘Nah, nah!’ We just kept pointing at each other. From there we just cool.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Was that upon first meeting?
Madlib
Yeah, it was in L.A.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Next question is from JVRefill. Do you have any more Quasimoto projects in the works?
Madlib
No, no. I don’t really like to rap no more, man. I ain’t got nothing to say. I done said what I said.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That’s not you though, that’s Quas.
Madlib
We ain’t got nothing to say. I don’t even fuck with Quas no more. Fuck that n*a man.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
When’s the last time you saw Quas?
Madlib
I don’t fuck with Quas, man. He took my last girl, so I ain’t ...
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What is Quas able to say that Madlib cannot? What can Quas get away with that Madlib cannot?
Madlib
I think he parties more than me. Messing with hoes and shit. Not women, just hoes. Hitting n**s with bricks. You know, same old.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So Quas is retired as of this moment right now?
Madlib
Probably.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, okay. How does Quas feel about that?
Madlib
I have no idea, I don’t talk to the n*a.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
@Celestaphone asks... you’ve mentioned an upcoming...
Madlib
Who?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
@Celestaphone, you’ve mentioned an upcoming Beat Konducta album with industrial samples.
Madlib
Industrial samples.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How did you know that I was going to ask that question? Did you read this? Any news on that?
Madlib
It’s coming. It’s coming.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I don’t know if Celestaphone is going to be happy with that vague of an answer.
Madlib
It’s coming. I don’t really know about dates when records come out. Maybe a year, maybe a month, I don’t know.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
By industrial, what does that mean? Industrial?
Madlib
Like Throbbing Gristle and... that’s nuff said.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
How long have you been into that sound?
Madlib
Since I been sampling.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
It’s in my beats, certain beats.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
It’s funky, for sure.
Madlib
Yeah. It’s like hip-hop. If it’s funky, I’m going to use it. I don’t care. I found some good country shit too.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Oh word? Country?
Madlib
Charley Pride breaks.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
For real, Charley Pride breaks? 
Madlib 
[laughs]
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You just started a mad Discogs...
Madlib
I’m sure there’s something in everything, yeah. [laughs] 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Shout out to everybody on Discogs right now looking for Charley Pride breaks. I think we’re going to try to maybe take some questions from some of the folks in the room. If you happen to have a question. 
Audience member 
One of the reasons I flew in from Russia was to be in this room here tonight, so my question kind of stems from there, can we ever expect a Russian beat production tape? 
Madlib
Oh yeah, yeah.
Audience member 
Because we’ve got records.
Madlib
I went out there last year and bought everything. So it’s coming but I don’t have dates on things. It’s already done, but I don’t know when it’s coming out.
Audience member 
Thanks.
Madlib
Thank you.
Audience member 
Check, check. I’m faded right now.
Madlib
Gimme some!
Audience member 
I’ve got a water bottle right here?
Madlib
Gimme some!
Audience member 
Number one spot to eat in Oxnard?
Madlib
I ain’t been to Oxnard since ...  actually Taco De Mexico.
Audience member 
Is that in Oxnard?
Madlib
It’s in Oxnard, yeah. Taco de Mexico on Saviers Road. You get killed fucking around.
Audience member 
One more question: what do you think about the new school beat scene that’s coming out right now?
Madlib
I love it. I love the young dudes. I love it all. I don’t love it all but I love some of it.
Audience member 
Any particular artists that you can name?
Madlib
Actually, nah, not really. I have some dudes under my wing but I still ain’t got no names. Barely remember my name. But it’ll be in the series. All the young dudes coming out on my shit.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
But you are releasing records by some of these younger performers?
Madlib
Yes sir.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
But they don’t have names yet?
Madlib
They will.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Okay, good.
Madlib
In time.
Audience member 
What’s up? What’s going on?
Madlib
What’s up bro? What’s up homie?
Audience member 
I was just curious to know, I don’t know if a lot of people know this but you work out of a, if I’m not mistaken, it’s a Free Mason castle?
Madlib
Yeah, I think so.
Audience member 
I just wanted to know what was the reason why you decided to purchase …
Madlib
Cheap rent.
Audience member 
What?
Madlib
Cheap rent. I don’t own the shit, I’m just renting the shit.
Audience member 
You still work out of that studio? 
Madlib
Yes sir. I’ve done most, half my shit in there.
Audience member 
Thank you.
Madlib
Come on through. You could see me over there. Everybody see me. In the hood.
Audience member 
Hey man.
Madlib
Hello sir.
Audience member 
If you could produce an album, or make a beat CD, if you could make a beat CD, like you did one with Prince, what other legendary artists would you want to do any type of album with? Like maybe a Stevie Wonder/ Madlib album? Something like that.
Madlib
I usually do that when I make beats. I just pull out the whole section of the artist and just make a whole ... Just try to sample everything I like from the artist. I’ve done that with like Rick James, Steve Kuhn, whoever. Whenever I pull out a record I usually sample the whole record. But that don’t mean it’s going to be out there like that. You know. 
Audience member 
Thank you.
Madlib
Thank you sir.
Audience member 
Hello.
Madlib
Hello.
Audience member 
What’s your next album Bandana gonna talk about? 
Madlib
One more time? Sorry.
Audience member 
Bandana, the next album. 
Madlib
Bandana.
Audience member 
What’s it about to you?
Madlib
It’s about, pimping, drug dealing, killing, realizing you shouldn’t be killing, you know that type of stuff.
Audience member 
Do you participate in the lyrics? Do you comment?
Madlib
Oh I wrote all that shit. I wrote all the lyrics. No I’m playing, nah. I let him do what he do and I do what I do. If I’m messing with a artist, I’m not going to tell him what to do otherwise I’m not going to work with him. You have to know what you’re doing and trust me to know what I’m doing too.
Audience member 
Do you have some criteria when you work with people? 
Madlib
Nah I usually work with like-minded people. If we don’t like a song we just don’t put it out. I mean we can always get an album out of something. I don’t really critique. If I have to critique you I’m not going to work with you.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
That’s how the Jaylib album was done more or less, and the Gibbs album. Was you guys basically, remotely, sending stuff to one another, right?
Madlib
That’s how it’s always been done actually because I’m always constantly working. I don’t have time to sit there and coach you in the studio. And you just do what you doing, and let’s see what’s going on.
Audience member 
What is, or was, your favorite record store in LA?
Madlib
Favorite record store in LA? Probably ... I don’t really buy records in LA, ain’t nothing out there no more, actually.
Audience member 
What about Aron’s?
Madlib
Aron’s is closed.
Audience member 
I know.
Madlib
That was my favorite store back in the day yessir. Right now I like Rockaway Records because they get a lot of rare stuff.
Audience member 
What was it about Aron’s that you …
Madlib
I was cool with all the employees and I get discounts.
Audience member 
Thank you.
Madlib
And they had good records too. Thank you.
Audience member 
Hey. So out of everything you’ve released through the years, what’s your favorite project?
Madlib
Nada, nunca.
Audience member 
What’s that?
Madlib
Nothing.
Audience member 
You don’t have a favorite?
Madlib
No.
Audience member 
Why’s that?
Madlib
I don’t know. I just don’t have a favorite. I like different things so I can’t be like “yo this is my favorite,” it’s always different. 
Audience member 
Fair enough
Madlib 
I don’t have a favorite. What’s your favorite?
Audience member 
Hey.
Madlib
Hello.
Audience member 
How was hanging out with Four Tet and Floating Points?
Madlib
Four Tet? Oh that’s the homies. I love him. We like the same type of music. Even though we do different things.
Audience member 
Have you guys spoken about doing anything?
Madlib
Yes.
Audience member 
When’s that going to happen?
Madlib
Um, if I’m alive tomorrow? I don’t plan ahead like that. We’ll see. Thank you.
Audience member 
You mentioned you usually sample whole albums from artists you like. What do you do with the unused samples? Do you ever revisit them?
Madlib
No, I just move on. I just keep moving on. I don’t know, I just keep moving on. I don’t want to release everything.
Audience member 
Do you keep them or do you delete them?
Madlib
Oh if I record something down, then I keep it. I’m not going to record it if I got to delete.
Audience member 
Hi.
Madlib
Hi.
Audience member 
I’m from the Bay Area, California.
Madlib
Yeah, that’s where my grand mama from. Oakland, east Oakland.
Audience member 
How do you define yourself as successful? What makes you successful?
Madlib
Successful? Still struggling, I don’t know. But just taking care of my family basically. And keeping a roof over my head and doing everything I want to do in life and not have to second think anything.
Audience Member
Hi.
Madlib
Hello.
Audience member 
I was wondering if you could talk about your collaboration with MF Doom and what that process was like?
Madlib
The process wasn’t really a big deal. We just hung out, went to clubs, got drunk, I’ll hand him a beats CD, I go to sleep, he’ll work on some music, he’ll go to sleep, I’ll wake up, I’ll make some more beats, listen to what he did, we might take some shrooms together if we awake at the same time, and then listen to the music when it’s done.
Audience member 
Can you see anything else coming out of you guys anytime soon?
Madlib
I don’t think so. Because people are expecting too much and they’re complaining about certain things that this DOOM record isn’t going to have any way, mastering and mixing. We like our stuff dirty. I think people are on a different level now. That was good for then, but now times are different. I like to listen to the album though, I love it. I love the new album.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I mean do you really think so? That people would have a different expectation?
Madlib
Yeah, yeah people have too many expectations, thinking it should be this or that. But it’s just a continuation.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah.
Madlib
Really a step above or a step lower, it’s just more songs. It’s not like ...
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You explained the process but conceptually did you guys have like “oh we’re going to have this type of idea?”
Madlib
No. No. It’s all freestyle. You don’t sit there and plan. It’s just freestyle and it just happens. It’s the best way for us.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
And that’s more or less the same way with a lot of these collaborative projects for you right?
Madlib
Yeah. Luckily.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Who’s next?
Audience member 
Hi.
Madlib
Hi.
Audience member 
I just wanted to thank you. You did a super amazing set last year at the Dilla Weekend in Miami.
Madlib
Thank you.
Audience member 
You’re welcome! And I wanted to know if you would sign my record for me?
Madlib
No. Yeah, yeah, all good, all good. 
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
Who’s next? Does anybody else have a question for Madlib while he’s signing this record?
Madlib
That’s it? I’m out!
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
One or two more.
Audience member 
I’m pretty sure every body else would like to know this but what’s the most annoying thing that DOOM would say working with you?
Madlib
Umm… the most annoying thing?
Audience member 
Or vice versa?
Madlib
[pauses] Maybe my blunts were rolled kind of crazy? For him? I ain’t tripping on him. He’s like Bird to me, like Bird the jazz musician. So I’m cool with everything he does. Understand a little, we cool, ain’t nothing like that. Or maybe he might eat my last frozen dinner or some shit.
Audience member 
Have you ever thought about DJing techno, because you were on a bill last week with three guys who do more techno and house and way back jazz influences. You played with Daphni, Floating Points, and Four Tet right?
Madlib
Yes.
Audience member 
You know their approach to live sets and stuff… the kind of music they play. Have you got anything more over that side? I don’t think I’ve heard anything from you like that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So, what is his approach to doing a live set more or less?
Audience member 
Yeah.
Madlib
Just freestyling, and playing weird shit and make people feel weird. They want to hear Quasimoto but I might play some crazy ass psychedelic rock shit just to fuck em up. I might not mix even though I can mix very well but I just might not mix, fuck it. I make it like a record, interludes and shit.
Audience member 
Cheers.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think part of the question also was, is that also a thing where you’re dealing with expectations?
Madlib
Yeah but I don’t go by that. Because if you know me, you know that I like everything so you might hear whatever. If you don’t realize that, that’s your problem.
Audience member 
Do you have a goal to achieve in music?
Madlib
A goal to achieve in music? Be a better musician, live wise, playing instruments and things. I’m learning to write music and things so I just want to do that better.
Audience member 
Do you have anymore instruments that you want to be able to learn?
Madlib
Yeah, I’m gonna do a whole album with just harmonica and whistling.  Egon on the whistle, me on the harmonica. Electric wah wah harmonica. Nah, I don’t know. Whatever.
Audience member 
What gives you the stregnth to go on everyday making music? What gives you the strength to do music all the time?
Madlib
I don’t think about it. It just happens. It’s how my parents were and that’s how I am. I got it from my parents.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well we look forward to the harmonica and whistling LP, forthcoming …
Madlib
The night whistler.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
I’m sorry what?
Madlib

Thank you for coming out. And thank you for supporting my music, whether you just listen to it or whether you buy it. If you ain’t got no money just download it. Thank you for listening and thank you.
