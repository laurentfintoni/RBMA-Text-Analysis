Gerd Janson 
We have a nice gentleman from Paris, France here, who goes by the name of Pedro
Winter, aka Busy P. He has done a few things behind the scenes, as well as on
the scenes. He has been the manager of a well-known
duo and another well-known
duo, and of a great and
quite successful label called Ed Banger. So, please give this man a very warm
welcome. [applause]
Pedro Winter 
Bonjour, bonjour. So, yes, I am from Paris, France, I crossed the channel to
come to London. In fact, I am in town to celebrate the seven years of my small
label, Ed Banger Records. We are throwing a party tonight and Red Bull people gently proposed me to come and visit you, and I like this kind of unprepared stuff. You are
from all over the world, I believe. Anyone here from France except me and
those two crazy drunk guys I met yesterday? We are the only Frenchies. So this is amazing, I’ve been lucky
enough to visit the Academy this morning.
Gerd Janson 
We are glad to have you here. But who is Ed Banger?
Pedro Winter 
I was jealous, in fact. If I can speak to the Red Bull people, I was jealous
that I’d never been invited to such a crazy thing, having your own studio 24
hours a day. I wish I could come and, like... How has it been so far? Any good tracks? Did you achieve
something or did you just get drunk in London and get far away from your country? Both? Good.
Gerd Janson 
It’s like Christmas for them, extended over two weeks.
Pedro Winter 
Me, the only Academy I trust is the Police Academy, but I’m happy
to see what is going on at the Red Bull Music Academy.
Gerd Janson 
So you didn’t go to music school?
Pedro Winter 
No, I wanted to become a lawyer. When you’re a kid you want to be an
astronaut, you want to be a fireman, you want to be an actor, you want to be a
star. Me, I wanted to be a lawyer.
Gerd Janson 
Why a lawyer?
Pedro Winter 
I don’t know, it’s not sexy, but this is how it was in my head at the time. I
knew I wanted to be a lawyer in the entertainment business. Sorry, I’m going
back to get to slowly arrive to what I’m doing right now. I wanted to be part of the entertainment
business, but I wanted to be behind. I wanted to create the magic, all the work you have to
do put on a show. The work you have to do to put out a record. So I started my university. I have to be honest, I did it
for three months.
Gerd Janson 
You were that quick a learner? It only took you three months to get your
degree?
Pedro Winter 
It took me three months to be lucky enough to meet some guys in a record shop in Paris, and it was the Daft Punk boys. I was only 20 years old, I was a bit late at school. At the time in Paris, I was throwing some parties in a club and I invited them to play for me.
Gerd Janson 
What kind of parties?
Pedro Winter 
At the time it was in ’95 and my life was all about house music, especially New
York house music. So, Kenny
Dope and Louie
Vega were my gods, I have the
biggest collection of Masters At Work recordings. For those of
you who know them, you know it’s hard ‘cause those guys are…
Gerd Janson 
Very prolific, it was like a remix a week.
Pedro Winter 
Every two days, man. Especially in ’95. So, it was really house music, and you
probably know those names, but at the time the guys playing in my parties were
DJ Gregory, Dimitri From Paris, Philippe Zdar of Motorbass, who became Cassius later on. And then two
robots, the Daft Punk boys. So we became friends. We were 20 years old, the
three of us. We are from 1975. And I quit school, I quit university. There was no point
continuing in trying to become a lawyer and at the same time throwing parties,
traveling the world and trying to learn a job. And I learned the management business, even though I hate this. I don’t feel comfortable being a manager.
Gerd Janson 
Before we come to the managing part of managing a group, what attracted you
that kind of house music from New York, especially? If you want to be pigeonholing, it’s a very
different musical style from what people associate with you these days.
Pedro Winter 
If you want to go back, back, back, my very first rave party in ‘92 in Paris,
I discovered electronic music with a pop group called Deee-
Lite that you probably all know. But
I didn’t fall in love with Deee-Lite for “Groove Is In The
Heart,” but I fell in love with the track “What
Is Love,” which I
hope you all know, a track from the album in 1989. This is the first time I
got repetitive music in my face. You know, when you’re 14 years old you can
start to realize things. Before that you get it from people around you, your
brother, your cousins, your parents, radio. But it’s not your choice, you know? I love it when people say, “I discovered
Run DMC when I was 10 years old.”
That’s not true, at 10 years old you shut up and you’re just listening to what
people are throwing at you. So “What
Is Love” in ’89, I thought I love this
kind of trance, repetitive music. Then electronic music arrived in France in
the gay clubs, but at the time I was too small, too young to go to those
places. Laurent Garnier, David Guetta – this might be surprising – but
David Guetta used to DJ with Laurent Garnier in a famous club called Boy.
I could never go because I was too young, but I know, people have given me
this knowledge. So it was the first wave of electronic music in France and me, I
discovered it with the second wave, in ‘92, in these big raves in warehouses
outside Paris. At the time I was skateboarding, all my life was about heavy metal and crazy stuff. But we were there, ten guys, we arrived in this warehouse, 3.000
or more. Lenny D, Ralphie Dee, all those names you know from this ‘90s electronic scene.
Gerd Janson 
They were playing hard and fast techno.
Pedro Winter 
It’s good you’re jumping on this because it was really hard music at the
time. I enjoyed this rave thing and this crazy experience for a few years.
Then at some point three years later, I was a bit fed up. Going to those raves was kind of a trip a trip, you had
to take these shuttle buses outside Paris, not that easy. You’re like one or
two hours away from Paris at seven in the morning. What the fuck am I doing
here? So I gave up on it and discovered that Paris had some nice clubs. One of
them was Rex club, where a famous DJ called Laurent Garnier was throwing parties called Wake Up. Wow! Derrick May, Juan Atkins, all those guys were
spinning with Laurent Garnier and it was 20 minutes away from home. No more mud on
my shoes, no more crazy trips. Then I discovered this techno music. Before
that, in the raves, especially early ‘90s, it was trance-y. Today, I don’t think I
would listen to it. Then I discovered techno music, then from club to club you
discover other music and I discovered house music. We have the French
radio, which is unfortunately now a bit crap, called Radio
FG. It was a gay or alternative radio that turned
into more of an electronic and house radio [station]. DJ Deep, who was a very famous DJ in Paris, and
DJ Gregory had a show. It was called Deep Groove, and it was all about house
music. I spent my money buying records, but then I wanted to be more a part
of this electronic thing. You are part of it, I’d like to say that, this whole
movement. You are part of it from the dancefloor, people in the clubs. It’s
not all about the DJs, the VJs, the promoters. It’s about people who are dancing.
From dancing I thought, “I wanna be that guy,” so I wanted to become a DJ. In
’95 I started to DJ, again in this whole electronic movement thing. Then I
thought, “I want to play my own record,” so I produced myself. Then I thought,
“I want to have my own label,” on and on and on, being part of it, feeling
responsible for what we are doing, now with Ed Banger, but also with Daft Punk
and other artists. I threw my whole body into this electronic movement.
Gerd Janson 
Do you have any of these house tracks with you? Something that grabbed you
back then and never left you.
Pedro Winter 
I should have prepared this one.
Gerd Janson 
You said you like it to be unprepared.
Pedro Winter 
You know what? We are lucky. It’s kind of symbolic, even though it’s not
completely pure New York house music. But it’s someone I really like, and I
just found him. It’s nothing to do with house from New York City, it’s an
artist called Daniel Wang from Balihu
Records, you’ve
probably heard of him.
(music: Daniel Wang – unknown)
Gerd Janson 
This track is also an example of using samples in a nice way, right? It’s full of them.
Pedro Winter 
It’s full of them. But since when is using samples a problem?
Gerd Janson 
It became one for Danny Wang himself. He started saying it’s very bad
using samples and he hates his old stuff and no one should sample and everyone should just do their own music.
Pedro Winter 
Sometimes people change their mind, you know. But he was good using samples and he’s still good without. But, of course, if we want to go on this debate, using samples and not using samples. Of course, it’s a waste of time. Use samples as
much as you want. If you sample my artists, we will sue you. [laughter] That’s all I can tell you.
Gerd Janson 
Have you ever got into problems using samples?
Pedro Winter 
I’ve never got into problems, but to be clear, it takes time and costs money.
Right now, on Ed Banger we have an artist called Uffie, a female MC. We’re
going to release her album at the end of May this year. I’m still working on
the paperwork to clear some of the samples because some of my artists, like Mr. Oizo still think they can sample and give me some tracks. “Oh Pedro, release
it.” Man, you sampled.
Gerd Janson 
So they don’t tell you what they used?
Pedro Winter 
Sometimes they don’t tell me, now they understand they have to tell me. But
it’s part of the game. Me, you have to be fair, if you’re sampling someone,
you have to share. I’ve never had any trouble, but if you want I will tell you
this little funny thing. I’m sure we all share the same love for this Detroit artist
called Jay Dee, and I think was about eight or
nine years ago for his band Slum Village, he sampled a track by one
of the Daft Punk boys. Because we knew Jay Dee and listened to the Slum
Village album, we were, “Wow! He did something pretty good with that.” Of
course, at the time Daft Punk, we were surrounded by Virgin Records and their lawyers, and they were all, “Pedro, you can’t let it go, you have to say something.” “Yeah, of course, I’m going to say
something, but I’m not going to go on Jay Dee’s back.” So we took our phone and
called Jay Dee’s manager at the time and I think we did something pretty cool,
we asked him to return the favor. So he did a remix for Daft Punk and he did
a brilliant track and now, with the history, I’m pretty glad we did it this
way. I don’t know if you know this one.
(music: Daft Punk – “Aerodynamic (Slum Village Remix)”)
So yeah, sometimes sample issues make good things. It’s not all about a shitty
contract.
Gerd Janson 
They can be cleared in another way.
Pedro Winter 
Exactly.
Gerd Janson 
Now we’ve got back to Daft Punk, please fill us in on the magic fairy tale. So you met those two guys and they said, “Hey, you want to become a lawyer?”
Pedro Winter 
Let’s do it quick, you know, because there is not much to say about it. Twenty-years old,
I didn’t know nothing about the music business. The boys, too, didn’t know
nothing about the music business. They were also 20 years old. I started work
for them in summer ‘96 and in September we took the Eurostar for the first
time in our lives, and we were invited to Virgin Records. You can imagine,
20 years old, wow! We’re like this, looking all around. The boys signed the
contract with Virgin. The album came out January 1997, it was Homework. After that it all happened, I hope you all know of Daft Punk.
Gerd Janson 
Is someone not familiar with Daft Punk?
Pedro Winter 
First, the most important thing I owe them is them being genius. So from that day, they have to have the full credit of their success. Their intelligence they
had at the time, and it wasn’t easy for some kids. I really insist on the fact
that we were 20 years old and at the time it’s really hard. You are young and
success is coming near you, it’s really hard to say no. I think the secret of Daft Punk is being king of the no. I was the king of the no, because I was the one
saying no to everybody. They protect themselves and we get everybody from
Björk to Madonna to George Michael knocking on the door.
Gerd Janson 
What do you do when Madonna calls?
Pedro Winter 
You hang up the phone – not with her, but her manager – and call the boys and say,
“Woah, woah, woah, we’ve got Madonna on!” But at the same time, this is the
funny thing. They were not running after success or fame, and they knew what
they didn’t want to do.
Gerd Janson 
Pictures, for instance.
Pedro Winter 
What is that?
Gerd Janson 
Photographs.
Pedro Winter 
Oh, yes. They wanted to protect themselves, hiding. They want to be cool, to take the subway in Paris, go to the bakery without being assaulted. So they
knew what they didn’t want to do, and they knew what they wanted to do. They
managed a career with a dream of being an artist and being able to express
yourself with music, your movies and your videos. All the money they got, they
reinvested it in their productions. When we did the videos with Michel Gondry, with Spike Jonze, those names you’ve probably heard of, at the time it was a lot of money. Even though nowadays unfortunately no one cares about video. At the time we were spending a lot of money. We were creating art. We were creating pieces. Now, no one cares.
Gerd Janson 
Why is that?
Pedro Winter 
I don’t know, I don’t have the answer.
Gerd Janson 
MP3 killed the video star?
Pedro Winter 
No, no, no, MP3 saved lazy DJs like us. Me, I will not go into this talk about how it
was better back in the day. When we used to take time, spend money, it was a
different time. I’m more talking about difference rather than better. I’m very
happy and I’m sure you guys are happy to live in 2010. Look at our
equipment, I’ve seen the studio upstairs, you can make an album in a week,
release it the next day, sell it on iTunes, Beatport or whatever, send it to your friend in Tokyo. I’m happy to live in 2010.
Gerd Janson 
Me, too, but I meant, why do you think video is not important anymore?
Pedro Winter 
Because there are no more channels. There is no more TV.
Gerd Janson 
There is a channel called YouTube.
Pedro Winter 
Yeah, come on, do you get money out of YouTube? They don’t share
their success with the label, with the artists. YouTube screen your movies,
your art, you get nothing out of it, and they’re selling adverts – before I
watch your video I have to see some crazy advert for whatever. But anyway, that’s not the
point. I’m more talking about the change. It’s good to live with your time.
Evolution is a good thing. I will not go too deep into this. There are still some
artists doing funny videos, cheap videos. But going back to Daft Punk, they were
reinvesting all their money, got the success they deserved, and another good
thing, they were rare. They didn’t run after fame or success, so they took their
time. Again, as we are in an academy, we have to pass the knowledge to each other.
Me, as an adult now — wow, fuck! — I keep telling my artists on Ed Banger to
take their time. We are not in a rush and time is good to avoid mistakes and,
most important, to get better. Daft Punk have only released three albums in, like, 15
years. So it’s kind of a slow production process, but at the same time they’ve achieved at the same time doing
videos, photos. I don’t know if any of you were at their live shows in 2007, with the
old pyramid and all-light shows. This was a pretty crazy thing to put up
together. And again, they hit touchdown with this.
Gerd Janson 
Was there a certain moment from meeting those two guys in a record shop to
when you realized there was something going on? Was it listening to one of
their tracks in a club or was it just the Eurostar to London?
Pedro Winter 
First, an important thing. I was a fan, even though they just did two 12"s before I knew them. But “New Wave” and “Da
Funk” were two tracks by Daft
Punk I was blown away when I listened to it, so when I met them, of course I had something to tell them. It was in ‘95, again it was kind of a 109 BPM, George Clinton-getting-grunge kind of track. No one knew what it was. Do you want me to play it?
Gerd Janson 
Yes, if people want to hear it.
Pedro Winter 
For those who don’t know.
(music: Daft Punk – “Da Funk”)
You know what? I’m sharing something with you. This is a track that nowadays
when I’m DJing people are singing it, they sing it, you know they are. “Laa,
la-la-la-la.” It’s always impressed me.
Gerd Janson 
I was singing it yesterday, all day.
Pedro Winter 
Under the shower? We can speak on Daft Punk. So yeah, I was a fan, and then
having the chance… I had a really nice Chinese meal with Thomas of Daft Punk
in summer of ‘96 and he said, “We are in the studio right now, you should come
and check it out. And we’re going to need someone, a right-hand man or
something.” It wasn’t really a manager at the time because neither of them
knew what a manager was. He was like, yeah, do you want to join us? I think it took me 40 seconds to say yeah, let’s try, let’s give up
everything. I quit the nightclubs in Paris because at the time I was doing
parties. So I gave up on all those parties and started sending my faxes from
Thomas’ studio because at the time we didn’t have an office. It was all faxes,
no emails, the email stories would come soon. Send faxes to people saying, “Yeah, Daft Punk
can come to here to Germany and play,” receiving contracts by fax. Really boring.
Gerd Janson 
But how did you work your way through it, not knowing anything about the dangerous music business?
Pedro Winter 
Again, I think this is the thing, being completely naïve and fresh and new. It’s
like, we give you guys a new sampler or computer or keyboard, some new stuff, you try it and you have an accident, and when you make accidents you make magic.
Gerd Janson 
But, for instance, these guys in Chicago back in the day who were probably
influential to Daft Punk, they were naïve and innocent as well and they signed all their rights away.
Pedro Winter 
True, true, but we can go deeper into this. Thomas of Daft Punk has a father
called Daniel Vangarde, who is an old
disco hitmaker in France. You probably know some of his tracks, like
Ottawan, “D.I.S.C.O.” Hey, come on
Patrick, he knows it. So luckily, Thomas’ father got some music business
knowledge and it helped a lot at the beginning, so to avoid signing crazy
contracts or making bad mistakes at the beginning. But after that, signing with Virgin, and
especially a man called Emmanuel de Buretel, who used to run
Virgin France, who believed in Daft Punk and had some different approach to the
business. As I said earlier, Daft Punk wanted to change the game, so they
proposed some different ideas, they proposed a different contract and on and
on. We tried to make things move, and even though we were that small [makes a tiny zero with his hand] in the game, we were the little sand thing that makes things
move. Then there was the fact we were lucky, arriving at the moment when
electronic music crossed the border. I don’t want to go too much on a sad
thing, like back in the days techno was a forbidden music or whatever. Of course, it was
there before that. But still in ‘96, ‘97, electronic music wasn’t as big on the
radio or the TV shows. We were still close to the early years when electronic
music was still the devil’s music, or gay music. It was something that was not accepted. Now, you’re opening the Olympics with David Guetta. So Daft Punk,
Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, all those bands in the mid ’90s pushed the boundaries further and made it more pop music.
Gerd Janson 
So what do you think was pop about Daft Punk? That you can sing it along without lyrics?
Pedro Winter 
Exactly. And also it was a question of time. Like, I don’t think Daft Punk is
more melodic than Derrick May, or stuff like that. It was just a question of time. We’ll speak
about it later with Ed Banger, what I have been doing for the last years with Ed Banger. You are at the crossing of time where you are the right punk. Luckily, Daft Punk, with the help of Virgin
Records at the time — we have to be true, having such a record company behind
you helps to break boundaries. It’s not something we did alone.
Gerd Janson 
I know I’m kind of obsessed with pictures, but what did they say about the method of not having pictures?
Pedro Winter 
Oh, good question. You can imagine, a record company having an artist who
says, “I don’t want to do any promotion, I don’t want to do interviews, I don’t want to do pictures,” the guys at the record company want to kill themselves. “I’m
spending millions, I want you to be number one, you want to hide?” But after a few meetings and fights they understood that point of view, they respected
that. That’s why we have to be cool to Virgin, they were smart enough to trust
the band, who had a vision. But this idea of hiding themselves wasn’t like a marketing thing or whatever, they just didn’t feel it. It was naïve and fair to themselves.
Gerd Janson 
It’s nice that you have them in your robot persona toys.
Pedro Winter 
Yeah, I have toys of them. I quit Daft Punk management a couple of years ago
now.
Gerd Janson 
Speaking of time…
Pedro Winter 
I spent 12 years with them, and I like to think that when we split, it was
more like you’re 18 years old and your parents are looking at you and saying, “It’s time to have your own place now.” I felt a bit like that with Daft Punk. It was about time, and I wanted to try some other things.
Gerd Janson 
And are you still in touch with your parents?
Pedro Winter 
I’m still visiting my parents, those bastards are living in Los Angeles now. So, Los Angeles. Big houses, big cars.
Gerd Janson 
They’re living the dream.
Pedro Winter 
We’re far away from the good old days when they were punk… If you’re
watching, Daft Punk. No, now they’re enjoying life and they deserve it more than anything. And most important, I’m still a big fan and I’m looking forward to listen to what they are doing for Tron, they’re doing the soundtrack for Tron. Disney is spending billions of dollars and they are smart to have the idea to call Daft Punk to do the soundtrack. So I’m
looking forward to it. I closed down the big Daft Punk chateau with a big au
revoir to Daft Punk.
Gerd Janson 
What did you when you left your parents’ house?
Pedro Winter 
When I left my parents I had an idea of setting up — because as you can
imagine, spending time with Daft Punk is like living with a giant magnet, I keep receiving music or artists saying, “Oh, I want you to be my manager.” But
it was too much.
Gerd Janson 
It was like Facebook before Facebook.
Pedro Winter 
Wow, good one! It was Facebook. Everybody wanted to become my friend, and at
the time we didn’t have the auto-accept thing. [laughter] But out of those guys who tried to contact me I met a guy called Mr. Flash, a hip-hop producer from
France. He sent me some tracks and he said, “Pedro, I want you to be my
manager.” And I was, “No more, no more, I want to do something else.” Then one
day, it was a Thursday, and that morning I didn’t know I would set up a label,
I said, “Oh, I’m going to put out your music.” And I put out a track called
“Radar Rider,” which was a pure instrumental hip-hop track, really in the DJ Shadow – to give him his respect – big opera, instrumental hip-hop. So I put it out as the first Ed Banger. And my friend Philippe Zdar of Motorbass gave me a B-side, so I put out this first Ed Banger without knowing what I was doing. It was 2003, all the French labels were closing down, every record company was spending millions trying to find the new Daft Punk, all the UK was still dreaming of disco filter house and I wanted
something new, something different. During a famous cheese party — I was invited to a cheese party —  I met two
young kids.
Gerd Janson 
To a cheese party?
Pedro Winter 
Yes, I’m French. I respect you guys from Norway or whatever, so respect my
Frenchy style. [laughter] We fucking eat cheese like pork. And it’s melted cheese, it’s hot, fondue. Raclette. So we
were on a big table, I was surrounded by younger kids. Two of them, one little
Chinese, one with curly hair, at the end of the meal went, “Pedro, we’ve been
making some music. Can you come in the room?” And we went into Gaspar’s room
and they played me “Never Be Alone (We Are Your Friends).” It was 2003, and I told them to come to my office the next day. Three days later I was playing in a
French club that is closed now, called Pulp.
Gerd Janson 
Pulp is where people like Chloé and Ivan Smagghe.
Pedro Winter 
Kill the DJ, Ivan Smagghe, it was a
lesbian club at the beginning. Again, we’re going back to the gay scene. It
was a really nice club, a small thing, 300 people. I was playing one
night there and I played that track and something happened. Some guys came up
to me, “What’s that track?” By the time I do the artwork with Sony and press
the vinyl, we put out this record, and I lived on this record for three years, I think. This smiling is not really
what I’m expecting. When I say I lived on it, I didn’t live on the money, because you
don’t make any money out of it. Even though you sell five thousand vinyls, you don’t make that much money out of it. But it gave us enough
energy, it gave Justice the confidence to become a real band, give up their
jobs, go in the studio and record their first album. You know in a computer game, when you have a
racing car, you have the speed thing, how do you call it? [inaudible from
participant, speaks French] But which one do you have here? Nitro, better!
Sorry, I got to nitro. So let’s say “We Are Your Friends” was the nitro of Ed
Banger. So you can imagine, I felt pretty lucky. Second release of a label. Even though my story being Daft Punk manager, doing a new label wasn’t that easy. This is where life is pretty funny.
Gerd Janson 
But you haven’t had Daft Punk on the label.
Pedro Winter 
I haven’t had Daft Punk, but inside I was, “All those guys who used to call
me, who used to be my best friends, maybe they will play my stuff on the
radio,” and it’ll be [mimes taking phone call], “Hello? Hello?” I take it as
fun because it’s pretty fair, it can’t happen like this [clicks fingers]. But finally, it happened like this with Justice.
Gerd Janson 
Do you have it with you? Maybe one or two people…
Pedro Winter 
I don’t have it, I don’t play this kind of shit in my... [laughter]
Gerd Janson 
In your spare time?
Pedro Winter 
Because we are here talking between friends and no one is hearing us or seeing us…
Gerd Janson 
Eh, a few people might.
Pedro Winter 
I really think with “We Are Your Friends” we were lucky enough to release a
track that’s important for a generation. And I think “We Are Your Friends” will be important for what happened for Ed Banger and for the club scene. A track becoming one of the
biggest for house DJs, and [some who] used to be a big hip-hop head, all
those.
Gerd Janson 
So like Daft Punk it crossed over.
Pedro Winter 
Yes. Completely. Completely crossed over. Mixing things and reuniting worlds. Talking about Ed Banger’s parties, or
Fool’s Gold, Mad Decent or Stones Throw, when we throw those parties we have hip-hop heads wearing crazy colored sneakers. We have indie kids ready to rave. All these mixed things and I like being part of it.
Gerd Janson 
What’s your theory for having all these hip-hop backpackers going crazy to these tracks, when normally they’re too cool for school?
Pedro Winter 
Again, it’s a question of time. They were too cool for school maybe, but now they
want to party. This is another thing I’m going to tell my kids: Enjoy
life as much as you can. Don’t take it too seriously, don’t take yourself too seriously. I think
it’s time people had fun and partied and this is what we’re doing.
Gerd Janson 
Some academic theorists came up with the idea that it reminds them of early
Public Enemy, tracks like “Bring the
Noise” and that’s what attracts
them.
Pedro Winter 
We’ll see, we’ll see, we’ll see. But sometimes this is what surprises people.
When Ed Banger does a three thousand-person party with Warp in
Paris, of course, the too-cool-for-school, smart-ass, intelligentsia, techno heads whatever
are like, “What? What the fuck are Warp doing with Ed Banger?” Me, I’m like
this [holds up middle finger], we’re filling 3.000-capacity rooms and
enjoying seeing Clark kicking it and then
SebastiAn kicking it and the crowd
enjoying it. When we do Stones Throw and Ed Banger, people are like, “What the
fuck are you doing, Peanut?” And at the same time, Peanut
is ringing me all the time, enjoying our parties. But this is what I want to
do, this is what I want to DJ. When you are playing at Sonar in front of three thousand people, of course, you have to smack their face and play them banging tunes,
but when I’m at home – and you have the proof today – I’m not listening to
Crookers in my iPod. But I’m happy to play
Crookers to smack some ass. Mixing things is definitely the key, and again, seeing
you guys reuniting in this Academy, I hope you’re not going to be, “Oh, we
have the backpackers Flying Lotus fans in this
room, we have the LFO techno
heads in this one, we have those here.” You should mix things. Earlier on, we
were briefly speaking about Jay Dee. Jay Dee was one of the proof you can have hip-hop for the feet. He was from Detroit, so he was influenced by electronic music. But
talking about someone I know very well, and I hope you know, DJ Mehdi, an artist
from Ed Banger records, who produced some of the biggest French hip-hop songs. Really ghetto songs.
Gerd Janson 
For instance?
Pedro Winter 
What does that mean?
Gerd Janson 
For example.
Pedro Winter 
He was part of a hip-hop band called Ideal J, which for me, a tall, blond whiteboy, is not really the hip-hop I can understand. It’s raw hip-hop and Mehdi
was part of this amazing band. I met Mehdi in 1997 and he wanted to put a foot
in our disco game. I welcomed him because I was aware of his genius and he
embraced our electronic thing. Nowadays, for me he’s one of the best DJs around.
Now he’s playing mostly house music, even though his heart is in hip-hop, and
he’s playing house music with the ears of a hip-hop guy. He makes it twist a
bit different. He can get a dancefloor packed in a minute. Now he’s one of Ed
Banger’s most famous artists. And I’m just thinking I would love to see if I have a hip-hop tune from
Mehdi in my thing, I think I have. I would like to listen to one hip-hop track
and then what he’s doing these days. Nowadays, Mehdi discovered house music
and he’s in love with house music and is doing music with an English guy
called Riton, who you
probably heard about too. Oh, whoa, what do I have here? Oh boy, this is a special one, this is a bootleg from Mehdi and
only Mehdi can do this kind of thing.
(music: Notorious B.I.G. – “Nasty Boy (Le Cirque Mix Remix by DJ Mehdi)” / applause)
Ed Banger is going house music, right?
Gerd Janson 
I can tell, but your label is pretty diverse.
Pedro Winter 
It’s pretty diverse as we are and as I am, you know. Of course it has to be. It is diverse.
Gerd Janson 
That also translates into the artwork, right?
Pedro Winter 
It does. Wow, you’re a professional, no?
Gerd Janson 
I am.
Pedro Winter 
I was, “What do you want?” Now I understand. It’s pretty diverse first. I’m
not choosing, I’m not thinking, “Oh, I’m gonna release house, I’m going to release hip-hop, I’m going to release this, that.” It’s just the music
I like, and what my artists are feeling. It’s just a reflection of the world
we are living in. I don’t want to go too much into deep thoughts, like
diversity, let’s all be friends and make love together.
Gerd Janson 
That’s very French.
Pedro Winter 
That’s very French, it’s true we’re like that. But it’s better than sending
armies and fighting, like the English are doing. Ed Banger is the reflection of
your youth and I’ve seen some of you bouncing more on the Mehdi thing and some
bouncing more on the electro thing. This is what I want, being able to release
French hip-hop like DSL, for example. You are talking
about the artwork, those two are different [holds up sleeves]. Sorry, I
didn’t bring much.
Gerd Janson 
These are records.
Pedro Winter 
These are records, for those of you who don’t know, who are only
Serato or fucking shit stuff like that.
Sorry, guys. No, I hate that. Live, Serato, Traktor, if you are watching
us? So unsexy. Who is playing Serato? [noise from audience] Voila, voila! No, I’m kidding. Of course, with Ed Banger, we are still manufacturing 12"s, even
though we don’t have many record stores in Paris, they are closing down one by
one. I think it’s pretty the same in London, unfortunately, and I guess it’s the same everywhere. That’s pretty sad
for those who spend hours in record stores… we call it le bac in French, I don’t know the word in English.
Gerd Janson 
Getting dusty fingers.
Pedro Winter 
This is the last Ed Banger record, it’s a thing called
Breakbot. Even though we no longer
sell five or ten thousand, or the golden years with
Stardust, two hundred thousand vinyls –
I’m not kidding guys. This is way over. Nowadays, for example, Breakbot, we are manufacturing one thousand five hundred, which
is still a significant figure for an independent label like us. But it’s so
ridiculous compared to the numbers we used to do. But I still want to do it,
even though it’s not where we are making our money. But I like the object first,
as a vinyl collector. And can you open it please? Because I want to keep talking and I
can’t do both. But because we are in 2010 and I’m doing like a… oh, you’re a professional.
Gerd Janson 
I used to work in a record shop, that’s why I know the trick.
Pedro Winter 
Now, when you buy a record you have a little card with your vinyl, of course, and with this card you can
download the MP3 for you Serato players. This is the kind of stuff that is an evolution.
Gerd Janson 
And if I buy it on the internet, you send me the record?
Pedro Winter 
Yes, and I send you a T-shirt and my sister. [laughter]
Gerd Janson 
Oh, great.
Pedro Winter 
This is why we sell a lot on iTunes.
Gerd Janson 
How many sisters do you have?
Pedro Winter 
I’ve got some all around the world. And so yeah, I still like the object, even though myself
I don’t play with vinyl. I did a party the other day for DJ
Mehdi and the game was I did a hip-hop set, vinyl only. I didn’t touch any
vinyl for four years, and I must say it wasn’t the best set of my life. Even
though the music was magic, the mixing was pretty bad. But no one cares, so it’s good. But yeah, I still want to do
vinyl and the object is important. I’m working with a French artist called So Me, I’ve been working with him since the beginning of the Ed Banger adventure. I feel I’ve met my alter-ego, someone I
can trust. He understands completely the vision of the label. He’s coming from the dirty graffiti artist [angle], but
at the same time he wants to work more on pop images. He reflects pretty well
the work we are doing, he can do those colorful things, for example. I don’t have it with
me but he’s also responsible for all the Justice art direction.
Gerd Janson 
For the cross?
Pedro Winter 
For the cross, all this heavy metal-oriented artwork. I feel lucky I met this
guy, and he has my complete confidence. I’ve never asked him to change anything
on the record sleeves, and like I said, it’s been seven years now. My relationship with So Me
is… you are influenced in life and you don’t have to be ashamed of your
influences. I’m influenced by different people. Of course, Factory Records and Peter Saville, for those
who don’t know, this Manchester label. Peter Saville was the art director and he was
doing all the artwork for the label. I like this duo of the music head and artist working together and creating something. Of course, more contemporary, James Lavelle and Futura.
Gerd Janson 
So do you think it’s important to have the iconography for the label?
Pedro Winter 
It’s not especially important. There are tons of labels doing well and have
different sleeves every time, not having a concrete artistic direction. But
Factory and Mo’ Wax was a big
influence for me, and I didn’t want to recreate it, but I wanted to be in this
category.
Gerd Janson 
So the trick is to always have a new sleeve, but it’s recognizable at the same
time.
Pedro Winter 
Exactly, but not doing the same thing. I would be really sad if people said
Ed Banger was always the same design, always the same sound. I prefer people telling me, Oh, you have an art
direction and a sound, but I hope we are not doing the same thing.
Gerd Janson 
Speaking of sound, can we listen to it, because it’s kind of a new sound as well, an
old new sound.
Pedro Winter 
It’s a new one but again [looks through iPod].
Gerd Janson 
But we have the record.
Pedro Winter 
Can you play vinyls?
Gerd Janson 
We can.
Pedro Winter 
But I have it on my iPod.
Gerd Janson 
It will sound better.
Pedro Winter 
Since when is it better than my MP3 320?
(music: Breakbot – “Baby I’m Yours”)
Of course, since we are marketing geniuses, we released it on Valentine’s Day. But this is completely an accident.
Gerd Janson 
And it sounded so warm from the vinyl.
Pedro Winter 
Yeah, and crisp. But Ableton Live, now we have a special effect. Crisp.
Gerd Janson 
You can put it on anything.
Pedro Winter 
Hey, Logic.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe we should open it up a bit to these guys asking questions.
Pedro Winter 
Yeah, as you can see, guys, I can speak for hours and bullshit and stuff. Who’s got a turntable? [gives record to participant]
Audience Member 
I want to know…
Pedro Winter 
Where are you from?
Audience Member  
New Zealand.
Pedro Winter 
Whoa, boy! You did the craziest travel to get here.
Audience Member 
Over a day.
Pedro Winter 
I was in New Zealand last year.
Audience Member  
Where about?
Pedro Winter 
Rhythm and Vines, with Public Enemy.
Audience Member  
Rhythm and Vines, I was playing that festival too.
Pedro Winter 
We were playing in the forest.
Audience Member  
Oh, I played on the second stage, not the main stage, the second main stage.
A bit more main than yours, I think. [laughter]
Pedro Winter 
Way bigger. Hey, come to France and we’ll see who’s bigger. I don’t even know if
there’s stage for you in France. [laughter] Are you a DJ or a performer?
Audience Member  
Drummer. From an industry point of view, when no one knew who Daft Punk were
– and eventually they got signed and broke and everyone knew who they were –
from that formative stage, what’s your advice to people who want to break into mainstream areas?
Pedro Winter 
Unfortunately, this is what I’ve been saying. There is no recipe, no rules. Stick to what you’re doing. I
know it’s a bit naff to say that, but dream. Those who say there is a recipe,
they’ve lost already. When you see record companies trying to create the buzz, trying to create something, they’ve already lost. Ke$ha, to take a
concrete example. Of course everything was planned, but they’ve spent millions of
dollars and probably in two years nobody will give a fuck about Ke$ha
anymore. Do you know the soufflé? It’s a French recipe. I can give you the
recipe to have a big soufflé, but I can’t tell you in two years the soufflé
will still be up, it’ll be [makes deflated gesture]. I wish you to keep playing second
stage and enjoying it, having fun with it, rather than tomorrow playing the bigger
stage and then the next year being nowhere and without any energy for
creating new stuff. There is definitely no recipe, and I will never in my position tell someone
you can achieve by doing this and that and buying some radio promo. Do this, do that. There is no recipe. It’s a game.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe start a blog? Huh?
Pedro Winter 
You should get a MySpace. I should have said that! [laughter] But I hope you understand the thing.
Audience Member  
Hello.
Pedro Winter 
Where are you from, what did you do, which stage did you play?
Audience Member 
I played the shittiest stage. I’m from Portugal.
Pedro Winter 
[in Portuguese] Porto or Lisbon?
Participant 
Lisbon. I wanted to ask you, I mean it’s obvious what Ed Banger does is happy music, but was it a choice from the start, “I'm starting
the label and fusing house music with heavy metal”? Because I’ve seen you with all the Metallica T-shirts and Rage Against the Machine re-edits and all that.
Pedro Winter 
It’s not a choice. I don’t want to sound like an ego trip, but it’s about me
being a Parisian boy born in ’75 doing ten years of skateboarding. And it’s
all those bricks together – discovering electronic music, discovering Run-DMC
– all this together makes me want to do this label and mix these genres
together. But saying that, I’m not the only one. This is why finally the kids
recognize themselves in Ed Banger, there’s a bit of them in what we are doing.
I didn’t calculate, I didn’t think, “I’m going to take the Metallica T-shirt,
the Nike backpacker thing, I’m gonna be a fan of Jay Dee, I’m gonna be a fan of Kraftwerk, I’m gonna be a fan of LFO to be smart.”
It’s just the way we are. It also has something to do with being French. To be a bit like a patriot. We
are I think lucky – and I know I’m going to irritate someone – to be in the [speaks
dramatically] center of the world, to be in the center of Europe. [laughter]
But I really feel it, honestly. French people – not being arrogant and I hope you understand what I’m saying – we are a multicultural country, growing
up with disco and rock and rap and now with electronic music. And even though I
complain about our radio, it’s too commercial or whatever, we are still lucky enough to live in France where we can listen to a large range of music. You can go commercial,
but if you don’t want to hear commercial, you can switch off the radio. People go, “I hate Radio 1.”
Listen to Red Bull Radio if you want. Listen to
something else. There is other ways to get culture.
Gerd Janson 
Is it true about French radio that they play an English song and then afterwards the French cover version?
Pedro Winter 
No, that is not true at all, but I like your urban legend. But if we have in
France – and I wonder if this is true around Europe – we call it a quota and the stations
are forced by the government to play a certain amount of French songs. And
it’s funny, let’s have a little joke about Daft Punk. At the time that we
made “Around the World,” it was made by a French band, made in fucking Paris, but it
wasn’t a French record according to the politics. “Oh no, it’s in English.” It
wasn’t going on the French quota radio thing. But yeah there is this kind of thing but it’s not really interesting. But to go back to Lisbon, it’s
not about calculating. It’s just the way I am and the way you are. I’ve seen you
reacting on DJ Mehdi and reacting on Breakbot. I have open ears. I feel pretty
lucky to cry on Metallica and cry on Isolée. And I hope you cry as well on Isolée.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe he would even like a T-shirt. With a cool cat.
Pedro Winter 
Maybe, I wish. I didn’t prepare all this. You could ask this as an open
question, this one. Maybe some of you know that also aside from Ed Banger, I have launched a side-project called Cool
Cats, which is a merchandising adventure where we do T-shirts,
caps, sneakers, whatever. All the stuff that as a young boy in 2010, watching
Hypebeast every day, being a fan of
Stüssy from day one and stuff like that, and Supreme, I wanted to have
fun with this. Which is for me, again, another media. Of course there’s radio,
internet and newspapers, but I take merchandising as a new way of expressing
ourselves, of spreading our sound, and also, in a more business way, another way to make money. As I said earlier, now that we are selling one thousand records, it’s not like
I’m going to travel first class to Coachella. And to make money, of course there are the big artists – Justice, Uffie,
SebastiAn, Mr. Oizo – but Ed Banger is not all about that, it’s also about Mr.
Flash, Krazy Baldhead, DSL,
some other small artists that you might never have heard of. But I’m still
producing their music and I’m proud and happy to do this, and at the same time you have to find the money. So you find the money by
scratching your head, meeting people, doing deals with brands, smarter deals
in the better way. Shitty deals, sometimes it happens. Sometimes I’ve made mistakes,
selling my ass to companies that I regret. But that’s life.
Gerd Janson 
Which companies?
Pedro Winter 
I can’t say on video. But it was kind of recent. And it's not a big deal, because it’s done, it’s done. I’m not ashamed of that too. Earlier, you asked me if there was some stuff we couldn’t
speak about. Talking about the way of financing, funding your creation, it is for me not a problem to speak about it. Finding money with brands
is the new game today. How many labels are making collaborations with brands to fund
their labels? Most of my friends are doing it and I’m doing it too, and it can be interesting.
Gerd Janson 
Because it’s still stuff you’d like to wear yourself, right?
Pedro Winter 
Yeah, of course. More on the brands merchandising things, when Nike is calling me to do a pair of Nike, how can I refuse
that? When I am watching all your shoes, how can you refuse something from Nike, even
though they are the monsters? [laughter] But sometimes it’s good to play with the monsters. I’m just trying to make you
smile about it and to take it in a laidback way. I know electronic heads are
like, “Oh, he’s selling his ass to a brand. Selling off.” All this discussion about being underground, not
being a sell-out artist – guys, we are in 2010. It’s different these days. Enjoy life, scratch your head. When a
brand calls you. This is what I used to back with Daft Punk when I had a call
from Coca-Cola or whatever. And I was like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don’t even speak to me.” Now I’m
taking the phone and I’m scratching my head and saying, “Let’s try to make something out of it, something
interesting.” Especially nowadays at least brands, for example [points to Red Bull sign] understand that it’s not
about putting your logo on a record, putting your logo on a flyer, putting your logo on a T-shirt. It’s about
achieving something and being part of something. This is what I understand you
are all doing in these crazy weeks. Red Bull – let’s talk clearly – was part of this
big party I did in Paris with Warp. And to set up such a big party, and we have
Hudson Mohawke in the house
and he was there, he’s seen it, we had three thousand people there, it was a big party in Paris. Of course, I can’t
pay for it myself but we had some smart people there, they recorded the shows, put it
on the radio and I think it’s pretty fair as a deal. So, all of this, sorry, to make it short. Take life with a smile
and sell out. [laughter] All of this underground and mainstream is over, guys. You are all mainstream now. You are all on TV. [laughter] 
Gerd Janson 
And we’ve paid him extra to say that.
Pedro Winter 
In fact, and I say this with a smile, I’m definitely not paid to be here with
you today. And I’m happy to be here. When Laurence from Red Bull France proposed me to be part of this, I felt pretty comfortable. Not to be teaching, I’m no one to teach you anything, but I’m just happy, I’m 34 years old now and I know that, if I was younger, I would
be happy to listen to some French asshole who has traveled the world.
Gerd Janson 
You’re not an asshole, come on.
Pedro Winter 
Yes, I am and I am cool to be one.
Gerd Janson 
We have another question. First the lady, then the gentleman.
Audience Member 
I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.
Pedro Winter 
Where are you from?
Audience Member 
I’m from Los Angeles. My name is Jennifer and I’m from Brainfeeder. Now I forgot my
question. OK, now I remember. Because I’m from Los Angeles, I remember when Ed
Banger first came over it was more like a hipster thing, no one really knew
about it. This was several years ago. Now it’s come to a point where I can go to any mainstream club and then I’ll hear an Ed Banger party. It’s not like they’re particularly sponsored, but
that’s all they’ll play. And I’ll hear people that are the most musically
uninclined, I mean, they don’t know shit about music but all they know is Ed
Banger. Then you see a lot of younger producers coming out from our area, basically kind of trying to formulate that sound and come out and just emulate the artists that are on your label. I’m sure that’s worldwide, too. What do you think about that phenomenon of having a lot of biters? Your concept is
being original and well-rounded, but these guys are setting out to just copy.
Pedro Winter 
We have to be fair with it, that’s part of the game. Life is a cycle. Daft
Punk, 2003, France was a nightmare. We had like 20 fake Daft Punks at the time. It’s our
responsibility to offer you some real music. If you come to a real Ed Banger
party, I will definitely not play the fucking noisy sound that everyone else is
playing, because even I’m fed up. I will not be happy if Justice come
back with a new record that is [makes motorbike noise / laughter]. We did
it a few years ago, and I completely understand your frustration. When I’m DJing now, the
kids in front of me are like [looks wild] and me, I want to play house music.
It’s a cycle. Responsibilities, I hope it’s a good translation in English, but
I feel responsible. I’m having fun with my label and with my life, but at the
same time I don’t want Ed Banger fans and kids to listen only to shit, fake, noisy, distorted disco or whatever. I’m trying to open their ears. And this new wave of as you said, new
producers doing the same sound, this is the game. It was the same for Daft
Punk. It was the same in rock ‘n’ roll. How many the Strokes did we have? We had like twenty the Strokes. Luckily only one, only
two stay and like I said, it’s a question of time. We’ll be back
in Los Angeles in April and I will invite you to a crazy party, it’s going to
be different. From the music we’re releasing, the way we are DJing, of course,
we have to reinvent ourselves. The day we are bored ourselves, I can’t imagine
how bored the kids will be. Again, this is our responsibility to prove we are not just
hipsters or whatever. It’s cool to be a hipster. Again, don’t misunderstand me. It’s
cool when Urb, XLR8R, Dazed
And Confused, those are telling you you’re
label of the year 2006, 2007, 2008. Because this is true, sorry. [laughter] Three years in a row, what can I do? But not 2009.
Gerd Janson 
Who was it in 2009?
Pedro Winter 
I don’t care. Stupid underground shit. [laughter] Who was it? I don’t know. When I’m talking about cycles, this is the game. Sometimes you’re winning, sometimes you’re losing. Me, I’m a good loser, you know? You have to be a bit back and
come back with a completely fresh sound. But I completely understand because I know Los Angeles quite well – and fuck,
what a nightmare.
Audience Member 
You guys own the city, apparently.
Pedro Winter 
How can I apologize?
Audience Member  
It’s not a problem.
Pedro Winter 
No, those guys are polluting your ears, you know? Again, I want to make the difference. When I’m making fun of Justice and
distorted techno and stuff, I feel what we were doing is melodic noise, you know? But nowadays, it’s just too strong and crazy and…
Gerd Janson 
Noisy noise.
Pedro Winter 
It’s noisy noise. What’s the point? I can fart and it’s going to be more noisy. So I
don’t understand, so let’s go back.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Audience Member 
Hi, I’m Moises from Tijuana, Mexico.
Pedro Winter 
No! 
Audience Member
Yes. All the way from the corner. 
Pedro Winter 
Do you know Tony?
Audience Member 
Yeah, of course. It’s a really small city. [laughter]
Pedro Winter 
I had a crazy one in Tijuana. We got stuck at the frontier on the way back.
Participant 
Yeah, the border’s shit. It’s shit. But in Tijuana, I mean it’s everywhere you go. They even have a Daft
Punk night, fifteen year old kids have started producing that sound. They call it
microwave house.
Pedro Winter 
Microwave house? I’m calling my assistant, copyright, copyright, register
microwave.com. Let’s continue.
Audience Member 
But in a way, I think it’s good, most of these kids are like 14, 15 years
old, and they’re already making banging tracks. It’s pretty generic but you can dance to it. Especially, Kry-lon. I think Tony’s their manager.
Gerd Janson 
Who’s this Tony you’re talking about?
Pedro Winter 
Sorry, for the personal joke. Tony is a promoter from Tijuana. e throws
parties in Tijuana.
Audience Member 
Not so much anymore, it’s more spread out now.
Pedro Winter 
In 2007, he was bringing over most of the DJs from Ed Banger.
Audience Member 
And the sound was really, really big in Tijuana, but I see it as a good
thing nowadays, ‘cause those kids started making music at 15. Whatever sound you start
with, if you’re really into music you’re going to break through and create
your own stuff. It’s like if you start off playing guitar you might start with a crazy punk
or metal band, but if you’re really into music and you’re really into originality, you’re going to make
your own stuff. But going back to the question, is there such a thing as being
too famous?
Pedro Winter 
The problem is not about being too famous. I don’t have any problem about
underground, mainstream, overground, sell-out, Justin
Timberlake. A musician being known all
around the world is never a problem. Now the problem, as I can hear and I can see, is the copycat or the bad
education. It’s probably a question of education. Those guys are 15 years old. This is why we have to understand why
they’re doing Daft Punk nights. I don’t know the average here, maybe 25. But imagine, the kids coming to those parties are 15 – they are so small. You speak to them
about ‘97 when Homework was released, they were babies. So discovering Daft
Punk, discovering this whole club energy, mixing, these guys who are 15, they
don’t have this whole question about there being a heavy metal guitar and an
808 beat. They don’t understand
that it’s two different worlds getting together. This is why by doing stuff
like sending playlists to magazines, doing interviews, we have a
responsibility to show we don’t just listen to Daft Punk or Justice all day
long. I’m listening to different kinds. This is what we have to spread, this
is why they have to read our stories. Another interesting point I want to jump
on: The way kids are making music today, we all have the same instrument. Daft
Punk in ‘96, ‘95, their studio was two tables like that; 909, 808, Orbit
synthesizers, Ensoniq samplers, SP 1200
samplers, a lot of equipment,
sequencers, compressors. At the time, I don’t know the cost, but it was a lot
of money. No one could do this kind of music at the time. For example, Homework, only people with a
bit of money and a lot of equipment can make such an album. Ten years later, I’m in my hotel and I
can make an album with Logic or Live. This is where the turning point is, from
having the curiosity to learn those machines, Roland TB-303, all those things that were a bit tricky because those machines were not easy
to use. These days we are all equal, you just
press Apple-C, Apple-whatever. The difference is in whether you’re a creative
person or not. Unfortunately most of the kids making banging tunes that are cool to play in
clubs did it, like I can do it, in two minutes, Apple-C, Apple-D, Apple-A,
whatever, Live and Logic software. This is a turning point in the situation. Finally, anybody
can be an artist and make beats, but luckily art and creation isn’t something you can buy in the Apple Store.
Gerd Janson 
But with your pretty tight time schedule it’s a blessing for you. How do you
find to make music yourself?
Pedro Winter 
Because I’m happy to live in 2010. I’ve just finished a remix – I’m a bit of
lazy bastard on the production level. I’ve been introduced to Akai MPC
2000 in 1997 by DJ Mehdi and it
was how I was making music at the time. Recently, I discovered Logic, so now
I’m mostly making music with Logic. And you can finish music Logic in a
plane, in your hotel room, whatever. I’ve finished this remix for my friend
Tiga, it’s in fact not for him, it’s for his label Turbo. He signed a German band called Hey Today! I’ve just finished this remix and I’m
gonna use this time to go pee.
(music: Hey Today! – “Talk To Me (Busy P Remix)” / applause)
Gerd Janson 
We have one more question.
Pedro Winter 
Tell me.
Gerd Janson 
I don’t have a question. This young man over there.
Audience Member 
Hello. I’m Andrew from Montreal.
Pedro Winter 
Oh, no!
Audience Member  
Good segue.
Pedro Winter 
Pourquoi?
Audience Member  
The Tiga record.
Pedro Winter 
[speaks French]
Audience Member 
Mon Francais c’est pas…
Pedro Winter 
Oh, la la, you’re fucking Montreal English side. [laughter]
Audience Member 
I’m not from Montreal originally. Anyway, I have a question, I’m going to use
the broad term of disco. You talked about how you used to be into the skateboarding culture. I find it interesting how most genres, as they progress, they progress towards disco – like punk, even metal at one point seemed to be heading that way. You
could say Justice are an example of that too. And you’re talking about
skateboard culture. Why do you think that is, or do you agree with that? And
where do you think it can progress beyond disco sound?
Pedro Winter 
So if I understand you, you’re talking about two worlds that weren’t communicating.
Audience Member 
Yes.

It wasn’t a challenge, but this is what’s exciting, you know? Playing with some stuff
where you’re discovering different worlds. It’s about that. It’s also about growing up, spending 10 years listening to Dinosaur Jr., something like that. At some point you’re discovering other stuff. I don’t think it’s incompatible, and we are the result of that, the proof. When I say we, I’m talking about my generation and talking probably some of you here. This was, you know, maybe 10, 15 years ago, when DJ Mehdi
entered my life. At the time we were DJing together and we were playing hip-hop and electro and things like that,
people were still like, “Oh, no, we want only house music, we want only this.” They were still a bit weird about hearing different music. Nowadays, it’s not
a problem. Sadly, from my point of view, the hip-hop DJs went 100 percent into shitty
house music, bad taste. Luckily, for example, we have A-Trak. Even
sometimes I tell him he should use his skills. He’s the best in the game, he’s
just playing proper house.
Audience Member 
Also from Montreal, I should add.
Pedro Winter 
He’s from Montréal. I’m telling him, “Don’t give up on your hip hop roots.”
He did an Ed Banger party in Montreal and in the middle of the set he did a
15-minute or 20-minute break of hip-hop. People went mad. Nowadays, those differences
are forces. Mixing things is the answer. Mixing our worlds is definitely the only advice, finally, after this two hour talk with you guys. It’s the only solution, the
thing I would recommend to you in this Academy thing. I think it would be
funny to look at all your profiles and choose for you, because I’m sure you are still a bit shy. “Oh, I don’t know if I want to go with him.” But you’re
going to go with this guy in the studio. “But he’s a weirdo, look what he
looks like.” You’re going to go into the studio and maybe you’ll do something crazy. Mixing things is the key. Again, we are the proof. Of course, I’m going to go to a Rage Against the Machine concert when they’re playing in Paris and the next day I’m going
to see Derrick May at the Rex Club, and I’ll get goosebumps and I’m not the
only one. Maybe because we’re French, and we like to play different games. I’m
not saying we’re just taking the best of it, we’re really enjoying it.
Audience Member 
[speaks French] Oh, my god! Wow, alright.
Pedro Winter 
I love Canada. I’ve got a maple leaf tattooed on my arm, so I needed to show it to my Canadian friends.

My question is, in terms of drums, because I know there’s a specific kind of drum sample that you’re using. I’ve noticed from Daft Punk in the ‘90s to Justice in the 2000s and how that
evolved into much harder hits, now with your remix it’s evolved into a more
hip-hop-oriented…
Pedro Winter 
Because the one I use is 808.
Audience Member  
Yeah, and I was wondering if in terms of the stage from the Daft Punk to the
Justice, did you see a noticeable evolution of the drums?
Pedro Winter 
Yes, of course, it’s a really good question. Maybe it’s going to be a bit
technical. Daft Punk were using a 909 drum machine, which is the most famous techno drum machine. Justice, they are sampling their drums from rock and FM bands, so this is why they have their sound. The one I use on this one is the lovely Logic 808 beats, so it’s
different, but it’s just at the same time what I told you. Daft Punk are more techno, Justice are more into California FM radio and I’m more influenced by the master, Rick
Rubin, who produced Run-DMC and the
Beastie Boys who used the 808
Drum machine. So I’m trying to rip off Rick Rubin’s style, even though I have a
lot of work.
Gerd Janson 
Thank you.

Gerd Janson 
Then, I guess our time is up.
Pedro Winter 
No, you told me four hours.
Gerd Janson 
Four hours?
Pedro Winter 
I want to tell you about my mother.
Gerd Janson 
We have a lunch break, then you can go on for another two hours.
Pedro Winter 
I already said my outro by mixing stuff. But what’s most important is
enjoying everything and having fun with it. I know it’s really naff, but I’m not
ashamed of anything as you can see. Enjoying it. Making fun of yourself. This is the key. Because the minute you’re going to be a serious guy, you’re
going to make some boring music.
Gerd Janson 
That’s a nice word. Give it up for Pedro.
