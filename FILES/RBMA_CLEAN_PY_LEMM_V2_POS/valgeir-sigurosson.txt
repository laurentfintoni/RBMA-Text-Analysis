thank join u today everyone room right sure know person join u today case composer producer engineer spent last year release make music consistently challenge perception genre boundary home base iceland greenhouse studio please join welcome valgeir sigurðsson lot music discus extensive career start talk music make like play something understand particularly transformative listener set musical path today might little bit unexpected people let take listen song music prince dove cry applause obviously prince dove cry take back first time heard song maybe explain transformative think heard first film purple rain sort introduction prince maybe time life study electric guitar play electric guitar play like rock punk music start get interested electronics electronic music music production remember see film see musician use drum machine onstage guitar everything combination remember sequence film prince write piece music angry moment something turn drum machine play along like shit need drummer think one thing mean watch film maybe million time every little detail kind obsess time life picked song think one could picked record know live basically different lot music listen guess till point musical reference separately guitarist listener well yeah well also straight rock guitar clash sex pistol big favorite mine kind music try play nine ten year old opening ear band like japan talk talk use synths new romantic electronic musiccoming time study music play guitar mean anything prince guitarist composer mixer engineer basically one man band mean something potentially give idea could aspire multiple role music oppose limited one yeah actually big part think attract film way music make people machine grow grow north iceland thousand people living musician play lot time technology new time accessible today obviously want play guitar instrument knew necessarily want guitar player want make music time start understand produce music studio would way thing limit one band role guitarist specific corner know able write produce bedroom almost know attractive idea remember early set might actually start produce music actually go study yeah start buying roland drum machine remember get another roland keyboard jx actually still today machine guitar use actually neighbor home organ preset drum take tape machine record drum rock bossa nova samba jazz three different tempo could play along able buy drum machine way kind hand kind play around tape record point take informal education interest formal realm start study engineering london yeah move reykjavík start study classical guitar well around time interest also kind open classical music also sister play piano play classical piece intrigue music first exposure classical music engineering saw ad paper one day say free studio time come record demo go write song room go small basement studio belong guy formerly band sort lose interest studio bit get client pay time come four demo something like actually start ask kind picked curiosity studio environment come reykjavik study go like grammar school really interested actually interested studio picked say could come help want start come studio suddenly found place equipment microphone track tape recorder mix desk outboard equipment could help spend evening make music eventually six month later become job actually quit school job still reykjavik still reykjavik like oh let see guy still around think studio like get studio business sell equipment living basically record studio run actually living next door kind begin still run greenhouse year ago two year later actually decide would need go study bit formally live somewhere else apply go sae london study music production engineering separate actual education component time london specific musical experience city might access stayed reykjavik term thing expand musical reference point something like yeah think also part grow musical experience see different community away learn live important part education like learn life know want stay london longer try get job work end come back sell equipment kind transition able kind support studio work like edit radio commercial band demo write music kind spare time play friend think really important time go away come back kind see place different perspective return away know appreciate thing maybe forget middle would say lesson time spent study music actually important term teach gear electronics process create mindset sort musical life yeah agree think slightly underwhelmed course amount practical studio time quite limited day access computer school one main control room kind book month advance find people bring studio really mean kind retrospect learn survival make best think overall experience positive useful nothing kind hand figure come back iceland play band point decide create greenhouse still work today sound like partially reaction experience also building upon positive yes think stayed access equipment kept equipment mostly instrument thing could carry know go studio every project something like miss access able invite people come use space collaborate start get like collect gear bit deliberately little set enable eventually get space get bit serious know everybody remembers time computer use much thing know get dedicate tape recorder machine everything email everything else make music well kind slow get computer always felt counterproductive like move fast want move memory think much faster react whereas start become good tool collect gear set space something want first people come greenhouse guess time mainly produce people work mm hmm remember reaction space type studio location yeah location space begin start slightly humble set equipment like collect makeshift sort space industrial park name greenhouse actually come sort idea greenhouse idea kind concrete landscape whereas greenhouse today last year green area reaction people happy come space could make noise record good quality outcome sort connection necessarily gear space greenhouse found first location first record come bedroom community happen musical life ten year span basically lead moment decide found label separate sort know meeting nico muhly ben frost curious musical progression time make seem sensible well start greenhouse begin play different band different local act tour bit record kind learn side well keyboard player band tour one would kind produce record engineer collaboration kind lead studio come together space begin work quite lot bad taste label smekkleysa would always ask occasionally project group people kind similar interest music make guess question laugh suddenly good idea label seem like good idea first start right well start think label well guess start think earlysometimes come across project want involve label end like well really put effort nobody go hear seem little bit wrong instinct usually figure thing rather try find example right label project thought want get music release release start seriously think label studio infrastructure make record idea make music know kind come like way think actually want play excerpt something first release bedroom community minute long go listen entire thing excerpt nico muhly keep touch speaks volume first release yes music nico muhly keep touch last five minute keep touch heard go listen full album produce nico mm hmm guess sort funny story read nico describe want produce record base terrible sound first sent yeah sent start get know assistant philip glass look glass studio former headquarters new york work well sort sneak around start talk ask send music talk sent recording apologize record one microphone somewhere ceiling performance like yeah great music sound like deserves well immediately idea would make good version piece separate improve particular release listen modern classical music idea head want change way produce present know listen music look thing always idea want chang idea might want necessarily like want new music particular record thought record classical instrument way kind approach pop rock music would sin try break mean people might know difference typical record exactly traditional way record tends like big group people play maybe three six microphone something try capture room live performance try optimize space play really quickly try edit together good take way go studio map piece layer instrument instrument sometimes take lot care place mics treat record case time get much interested get lot closer source sound traditionally would get room record explore lot extreme close mic ing rather record thing stereo overhead pair would record one mic like close another one would balance sound like something hearing get maybe nuance miss piece heard keep touch actually record lot percussion element viola sample sound stuff viola suppose nadia sirota first time record together found use maybe classical people come classical world excite open experimentation process always train conceal imperfection instrument play beautiful sound space hop nobody hear scratchy sound string whereas would go amplify sound even though sonically different think really strong connection first three release bedroom community one listen speaks volume ben frost ekvílíbrium definitely genre music think unite factor music would something separate genre think really yhey sort connect feel like completely disparate think kind aesthetic share time still probably filter fact record mixed space kind involve way even though different capacity course felt strong connection way three u approach music make felt work perfectly together first three release label think far go explain feel much way approach music make change first solo release think change lot probably yeah curious write instrument notation process completely different funny actually feel like almost everything bedroom community exercise feel like education almost like maybe set bedroom community start like graduation like thesis something big project life happens real life real world think change way maybe think approach project maybe slightly relaxed way mature hope composer someone guide people process definitely spend less time studio use think music probably use know make sense always something go physically less think know go quicker maybe say always know go experimentation anymore think still big part process sit try edit work lot reduction pile lot stuff spend lot time sift take apart put back together throw stuff cleaning rest composition happens pretty fluidly rapidly yeah probably development know put finger shift gradual also write music commission people guess second third album create different work mind initially sort challenge present fit music entity entirely guess ballet third film second vice versa yeah exactly yeah right yeah different project different challenge actually case positive almost someone else wait music happen contextualized way concept music architecture loss dance piece stephen petronio dance company title give title could run discuss basically title meant meant thought thought word put together go create dance piece however long music base title restriction place length actually suppose maximum minute program work could write music timeframe restriction project new construct live performance perform music dance begin first run could three people whereas work unlimited time always think live performance afterwards one first least big piece write specific number people mind work within frame whereas dreamland film big theme big subject want music quite expansive orchestral part never really think live music would played live since quite lot orchestra size like version create afterwards project built studio approach get small section layer together sense adaptability seem important general ability take restriction create something something small build think thread lot work yeah one thing nico especially begin speaks volume background performance ready performance mine ready studio combine start make different version piece perform whoever around nadia around play viola would play certain piece would electronics electronics would maybe include half pre record track would figure way make electronics feel alive interactive stand press button think reverse engineering record write cross way possible important thing work want play something dreamland title track think might butcher title try pronounce icelandic draumalandið guess okay pretty bad pretty good sorry laugh warn dreamland music valgeir sigurðsson draumalandið dreamland think interest environmental aspect make score specifically sort want unpack film alcoa former aluminum company america plant aluminum iron icelandic coast yeah dam project east well kind yeah one part film base book general exploitation resource nature corporation take advantage small community much value land versus short term profit could make one project translate something like music write film point complex topic reflect musically way mean heard dramatic piece music fun thing work film lot talk head lot people side argument project dam give time consider little bit go people say see lot landscape see lot nature often moment music play scene sadness lot landscape nature drown create big dam know find difficult make music illustrate sadness tragedy way think hard thing harder write happy piece music write sad piece music subject think bedroom community label first base iceland island create presumably large amount vinyl petroleum product curious thought relation label experience think relation country overall yeah obviously think time lose sleep guess kind weird time history sort product music move digital world well probably carbon footprint way power hungry hard drive everywhere thing manufacturing plastic product make fossil fuel something necessarily mean another way think gonna stop produce people still want love buying think vinyl responsible destroy planet think either think interest think context film think kind bother even shipping freight fact bring manufacture stock world different place quantity low point time plant every territory manufacture kind help get copy world price reflect manufacturing cost shipping cost kind weird place right think late release also reflect aware sort contradiction album dissonance actually last night heard icelandic music award best album dissonance first album five year come last year happen period make want move away focus produce people work heavily pursue solo composition really focus one thing particular accumulation different experience talk accumulation sure time like dissonance come five year make music write music meantime music take long time write think early piece probably orchestral commission maybe write much music kind point even time kind put album format release sort put context like actually development conscious think natural progression two half year ago twin life kind change way appreciate time always want actually forgot tell earlier left leave london actually apply go composition school never get formal composition education learn read write music play guitar think end okay yeah mean still make music music ever fine figure way always intention always direction tend kind thing speed reason focus less put focus write music produce closest collaborator bedroom community also time time precious feel like kind do enough moment maybe get back role heavily know see moment different energy feel like kind organize people life lot time thought emotion expectation bedroom community operates slightly different way project usually always ongoing kind dip toe many one week might touch send update version artist get feedback sort develops music ready might like week intense record sits hard drive work little bit work music well might project put energy go somewhere meantime kind work six thing much like open conversation go collaboration time different people write commission work theater film seem like enjoy make music moment dissonance well another piece music come concept head actual process composition start talk title track yes piece dissonance base second mozart string quartet long string quartet total original ten minute first four movement interest piece different everything write listen sound lot like shostakovich something much closer time call name dissonance quartet really use time hearing move fast original heard first time love dissonant chord come together really quickly resolve something kind consistent want kind expand moment want live sit minute time take score stretch think play bpm something like minute piece bpm figure record low computer could go divide think would go bpm basically start point piece kind explode bar sustain moment kind reconstruct piece liam byrne viola da gamba player built piece play string piece layer layer layer play minute time take many many day get layer sometimes discover layer sit something else something new maybe part layer kind process record shape dynamic one something layer prominent one kind chord lead reprocess amping guitar amp distort find interested sort sprawl nowadays oppose concision think really distinction case one well think longform piece comfortable sure know think go way really make comfortable think think well understand see kind future start piece long actually play live played lot two u live actually kind make understand piece rediscover way fun thing play live always rework dynamic go many way think sound least sound quite different one performance next let listen minute dissonance music valgeir sigurðsson dissonance first five minute minute go listen think beautiful piece music actually good end point thank much come today gonna open q people question microphone float around feel free shout question desire point someone audience mind wait mic hi thank wonder regard structure structure song music make kind approach structure yeah structure important know clear answer think always rely instinct one challenge kind longer piece think journey make sense tricky see structure good bad look kind able zoom yeah answer thanks anyone else actually question go important reference track mix master guess less less learn lot listen think master process mix track course help something know try test listen car listen club listen radio listen laptop speaker always sound good measure thing guess hardly ever use anymore think use convince get bass louder yeah actually mean reference track tend stuff work also kind easily easily analyze head remember process example think throat ben frost album think master five time something opinion master think brought u much way record sound mix mixed well master actually kind really push forward album go back sometimes anyone else wrap thank join u today really appreciate thanks
