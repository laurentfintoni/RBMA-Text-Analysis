take much time want lose momentum like keep go yeah say america two week long go two week without work mean way really long go without work choice go day really couple day maybe unless heavy weekend pretty rare day pretty good another interest project get come something interest quite different music sponsor music accompany human genome project art council sponsor thing artist thing get orchestra call scottish ensemble twelve piece ensemble want compose classical piece music give free reign say want use electronics feel free honest rather keep meant sound human dna unfold actually way approach different way work quite conceptual think create kind texture also lot contrivance ok four base pair dna maybe four instrument three different thing stuff like really play classical music rule think obviously classical repetition shift thing think go instead sit front computer press button go speak people play faster play harder play slow play weirder definitely scary bit deal people musician particularly musician use deal professional composer oppose producer give shot quite daunt actually go write music first take orchestra go work way could actually work orchestra way work compose sample home write score computer certain amount write keyboard piano roll compose like final thing hand think way know read music quite thing squarepusher thing london philharmonic orchestra one guy actually really gift musician real multi instrumentalist phenomenal bass player real musician know aphex really know exactly aphex twin similar thing london sinfonietta think exactly sure work know orchestrator orchestrate expect jeff mill recently thing orchestra call blue potential like montpellier philharmonic something play classic techno track orchestra sound little well acid brass brass band northern mining village play acid house classic jeff mill orchestrator basically orchestration equivalent photographer press button fair think someone else come approach idea kind vein tell philip glass remix aphex twin record sum beautiful wonderful fantastic thing create electronic music mentality come together classical vibe whatever background get really different background whatever background try bring influence make something interest anything combine genre classical aphex twin great great interface phillip glass mix icct hedral another catchy name aphex twin music aphex twin icct hedral phillip glass orchestration mean obviously know phillip glass mix aphex twin pretty much absolutely real actual genius guy thing let system ok would good time get question floor would like ask alex question youse want go home eh mass inertia take anything anyone want ask say aha microphone select track sorry inaudible yeah every track deconstruct bounce kick bassline single loop nine track track yep get like steup know track track spontaneous loosely grouped together quite often tune loop make sure everything tune key pick choose extent interested hear bit first start listen electronic music say heard hip hop craig mack inaudible guess techno one end spectrum synthesize music hip hop bit sample base seem like different kind influence yeah dunno particularly whatever move maybe expose also think quite honest know explain people honestly think want know explain another question back hi hi want talk little bit start track find daunt want scream start start melody head drum start track ok quite often bit enjoy start track like new clean sheet quite often try go crazy possible get something go totally impractical get five plugins row maybe choose five plugins random get something weird happen kind try rein afterwards try take far try control make useful quite good way approach kind really let go go make noise try bring line way melody head get keyboard chord definitely recommend full way get rid blank page syndrome longer get blank page front get something good way certainly also mean maybe push thing direction necessarily think go per say get another example way start thing aside kind way described try think get anything mean track start different way yeah track last album call prima materia quite orchestral kind rough do really realistically use lot orchestral sample way start purely try write way would try write classical write cello sequence think well need little offset violin little horn sequence like ok cool thank anyone else anything else inaudible ever sample play instrument honest never do recently one space whole thing actually record get good acoustic never really get around never really get grip whole live record thing card definitely nothing beat real play thank go say ever sample anybody else music actually hear people time really good bit control freak like really place every note know happen know never appeal get another question row ahead inaudible composition process life use program randomizer yeah sometimes limited sense example function logic randomize midi say randomize honest say bit control freak way use plugins maybe random term note ok ok anything else sort midi controller use live show ok moment something call uc okay get lot knob would like see midi controller could pick would honest big rubberize thing thousand light something bit pazzaz honest okay functional long get bit variety know like rotary button pad long get happy ok please give alex smoke applause
