today go talk final stage record process master people well talk u man left please welcome john dent applause thank much kick exactly master master make choice record track mixed track theory want something world competitive lot professional make really good recording something may sound weak lifeless insignificant may seem like work room studio west england sits pile gear reference monitoring system tell stark black white whether something get something get lot material studio especially record produce digital domain actually sound clever file get probably seven eight db quieter need get skill tool create much big sound file actually hit l kind happens workstation approach lot subtle tell client plugin construct signal path equipment come wonderful music give demonstration point master track exactly try achieve number factor end day someone try say something musically override everything also look type musical style genre someone fitting people invent new style always ballpark area someone fitting real world listen music finish accept hear music may well really good sound really good level imprint becomes identity music lifetime know tune hear everywhere tune get master stage would say necessarily case get master stage would say somewhere five ten percent receive approximately right somewhere close good level ideal five ten percent would analog tape get digital recording still sound client base work primarily analog us digital technology benefit offer quick cut paste effect use get tape pj harvey track sometimes record digital system zero automatically sound fantastic lot yardstick use large database finish master recording always matter course compare new piece music sound like database engineer actually rush hit knob tweak people sound sure try say know spend day master play track project try work track sound best start quite important one often client know come play around people get feel one particular track mix reason stand sound well everything else use yardstick album nudge everything else sound good nowadays lot different file format lot way deliver studio quite often often start project huge pile source material right work franz ferdinand album moment material tape mixed four producer come internet ftp different part world lot file k job become coordinator put project together middle main producer decide would nice put track vinyl prior make cd job go two month get complicate get back sunday first thing go back studio carry give bit piece add album master simple nothing really depth project get end much happen transform project form perhaps one would thought first place interest thing happen master room guy come acoustic album really struggle happy sound music put onto vinyl lathe say first time guitar actually sound like guitar entire record process really happy whole project like master plug piece software approach old school approach training experience anybody music industry others like many others certainly recommend get project want explore interest approach master get budget reward huge get background history maybe best thing type demonstration master record couple thing brought santogold single earlier year copy original data file academy crew member erik breuer able play follow master track work instruction producer record sound okay weight certainly bit thin distant compare want final result actually quite weighty heavy sound good radio good example music santogold l e artiste master fairly obvious would thought lot compression go do analog domain hard digital edge next stuff lecture red bull melbourne come back lecture bbc one guy audience funding bbc get album start stage lot guy heard lecture sort checked come track bit bit put album together brought stuff impressed whole approach three track think play music dr mika unknown john dent get idea clyde dr mika want good level want change track much kind art get master right say many professional around level get stage journey interest one start teenage record collector mad music ambition record work music apply bbc vacancy sent list london record studio manage get interview advision studio happen next interview trident studio take need three people man studio hour day sort tea boy runner assistant staff one three trident studio soho wardour street time probably lead studio country europe get job world every day walk queen manage trident time equipment david bowie use walk door prepare meal elton john record focal point lot music go time introduce studio environment work tape op main engineer whilst one guy disc cut room announce leave ask could go mad record collector thought disc cut lathe unbelievable give try train take literally like duck water clear like approach like training partly sit around watch go partly talk equipment work completely analog set quarter inch tape machine main replay recording dolby nice analog console mainly full inch rack gear pultec stuff like fairchild limiter really nice monitor neumann cut lathe first training niceequipment midbig resurgence music uk punk reggae manage start lot small band come would tell friend oh guy trident know cut vinyl quickly quite name artist client base turn cut record strangler first material two first album single work tom robinson motorway big track time vibe good ray staff train work lot rock band work genesis roll stone lead zeppelin real focal point lot great music time stayed trident one client successful island record cut new york need someone uk lot reggae found approach really suit material start lot bob marley stuff first record cut wait vain single exodus lead get live lyceum album really launch bob marley wailer career woman cry throughout time give great music work want play suppose could something cut right island yes something cut music bob marley wailer love temptation keep listen run time chris blackwell founder island use attend cut session work john martyn one world album chris express wish vinyl master studio jumped chance say look gear see find studio come work source equipment paris make contact finance people island start studio call sound clinic chris blackwell always view job like go doctor fix name come fairly free rein choice equipment interestingly enough access american equipment scully lathe westrex cut amplifier try little bit coarse fantastic sound start studio base equipment slightly unconventional enteringlots big producer big budget scar come studio saw neumann lathe get insecure go away music cut lot influential island stuff grace jones robert palmer bob marley steve winwood go amaze era island era want island yeah set house cut room island anyone familiar lathe explain point picture whiteboard yeah lathe vms built neumann shape form lathe date back probably pre world war ii kept basic design format earlyactually redesign lathe make bit shiny button push actually like sound system track groove adjust depth time music sound like compressor big fan set studio loud source lathe train big heavy piece equipment want move around set leave get microscope inspect groove side watt per channel cut power cut head black yellow object middle stereo transducer like loud speaker move arm actually hold stylus record physically carve everything see vinyl machine like whether make scully whatever many people around actually know work strange beast want run people cut time cut island tell yesterday cut dire strait yes building reputation island big client spent lot time work material rush thing remember could love cut vinyl physical medium sound get accentuate get lose people like good vibe record certain volume excite cartridge talk dennis coffey morning talk guitar pick ups say old gibson energy stand new one similar thing record start sound good decent level record lose thread talk island year oh yeah happen artist like sound come record big enough artist would actually insist cut room would cut major part whole world double album dire strait alchemy mark knopfler band really like do order come something like set cut double album dispatch across world order come two day christmas literally spent whole time break period cut dire strait record use happen band like genesis would six set vinyl cut simultaneously choose six sound best factory people really embrace medium music career work island island end work lot comingartists peter gabriel phil collins paul young one edition top pop every record actually come studio cut two third assistant cut third quite diverse thing cut three mot√∂rhead album rather interest story one tape work quite late night place one mastertapes bin foot horror next morning go island cleaner actually thrown away yard one huge six foot high waste bucket thing basically tip find tape alright sort thing use happen fast forwardset cut master room london right really come cd cd invent company like phonogram push dire strait one first cd client say john get cd gear kind fell lap master company supervise transfer cd island change quite radically go original record company head chris blackwell company really kind motivate accountant record label get money label get cd equipment expensive choice go bank told quite happy lend money engineer graham look premise found camden north london start building exchange work island tell anyone secret mission whole idea air long people rely u cut point take chris blackwell aside told look chris leave island come money perfectly understood even let u take equipment work hammersmith studio enough equipment second room top say look go give entire back catalog master cd pay equipment work way literally transfer hundred hundred album fairport convention cat stevens free name sometimes original producer would come supervise exchange get go independent studio train lot engineer exchange still go longer want something personal exchange room share manner engineer kind guy like switch go home come next day everything left project guy decide leave exchange rethink want live move west england put feeler manage find equipment quickly take week find whole master room worth stuff put studio together phone client like switch come start work ever since find loud master loudmastering com give dat cd reel explain process moment give get onto vinyl vinyl cd different medium thing need vinyl perhaps need cd problem vinyl cut good record sometimes people actually play back record player cartridge effectively filter well cartridge well record player less filter hear record nowadays people technics turntable dj cartridge back track type pick ups actually change sound quite dramatically might good bass change sound quite lot really hear record come dat first thing transfer onto sonic solution workstation reason lot listen play sound workstation bass sound much well play directly dat machine link clock digital system sound much well good clock get extension bottom end sound less harsh start make sure every record played back good get need explore need play record need see deal first test cut usually good level nothing do observe happens quite often record need bass sound bit dull form opinion need happen range deck get six different pick ups plug get feel sound push see far go push thing start distort break hi hat start break kick drum cut record thing like kick drum groove get extreme go towards label get jumping form opinion go music sound level right generally sound good next stage test cut put lacquer lacquer much large disc disc acetate disc cover nitrous acetate material bit like nail varnish quite soft modern day replacement wax basically cut machine cut play master cut cut one side concentrate side end disc side unplayed bolt box get sent factory factory wash spray silver electroplate onto disc pull reverse call mother metal version record reverse instead groove point stick stamper make electroplate second stage electroplate back record metal form call positive factory play check nothing strange happen physical process get lump grit plastic metal make noise approve positive electroplate form stamper combine two side record stamper put onto press press big machine basically push plastic record often automatic label system stamp heat record come press quite jagged edge trim hot wire record stack pile probably one hundred high weight top stop warp buckling may well do sleeve label design point becomes record something sell middle process advise ask test pressing factory lot go wrong one big bug factory hole cut disappears center processing recut load record cut center listen keyboard stuff wow get horrible sound constantly tell factory get wrong becomes unlistenable really listen something checked unfortunately stuck want send track master stage deliver get happy mix everyone happy mix get mix work may necessarily right level generally sound feel right right time send like idea extra compression extra limit maybe quick cd send record company radio quite often good idea send copy limited compress version raw uncompressed version least see difference make think work equipment use studio subtle achieve well big level without lose much nice get idea want without whole thing compress vinyl expert interested hear describe difference get listen record get listen cd world analog record high resolution resolution think term pixel day multi track record good desk disc cut actually get cut record technically four time resolution cd camera vinyl four megapixels cd one everyone different type record player vinyl could start cheap player knew bit money well cartridge record player could retrieve quality back hi fi whole industry design retrieve much resolution vinyl lot record cut pre digital era fantastic store sound lot people use sample high resolution sound format retain optional high resolution format get something show u yes zero interest one come u couple year ago like concept put music onto vinyl make cd test take stuff away compare decide want whole album garden album via vinyl acetate record tape right original source half inch tape mixed phill brown good engineer phill brown actually mixed bob marley live lyceum album cut backmixed zero album album vinyl go listen cd version listen listen experience music zero future cd vinyl version could anyone hear difference listen resolution pixel simplicity process would liken analog digital potato potato chip chop make chip chopped never vinyl record unchopped sound vinyl four megapixels cd one megapixel mp comment really feature mp outline ringtone outline go mp one hundredth good cut vinyl record subtlety way reverbs general feel listen experience get lose mp tends rattle tell drum kit thing record guitar noise good example come term training also guy lose sight fact world lot sound try create computer especially come analog era limitation get full sound another method give another example know lot dj room lot vinyl lover term ability go straight tape vinyl rare luxury go slight diversion otherwise forget go show trick even realize cut get sieve brain keep work work work found record cllection actually quite proud cut show little trick music george clinton atomic dog cut record aluminium disc cut actually quite heavy hear sound difference finish press disc cut disc cut sound well actually well bottom end record sit turntable get mass microscopically vibrate listen buy record clamp clamp record turntable give much cleaner big bottom end glass turntable add extra weight stop vibrate get use sound remove glass see whether hear difference music george clinton atomic dog continued another tip find record clamp clamp record turntable sound well back resolution thing customer brought hendrix track want use reference something played cd say weird half sound miss mean half sound miss pull ep year sure enough compare tell something wrong hearing cd know record master cd mp yes remastered cd tape see think thing record energetic lot stereo almost hear hendrix personality vinyl lot vanished cd music jimi hendrix experience along watchtower vinyl cd version cut vinyl cd version slightly well demonstration certain quality available cd quality important soul music tends go make cd subject vinyl vinyl junky room tell proper way set technics turntable mean cartridge everything ok issue one get weight stylus arm start point point balance adjust arm parallel record parallel turntable one part get recommend weight different cartridge need lot heavier record sound bit thin scratchy right weight actually stylus balance device weigh weight stylus primary way use ear light get bass heavy top end suffers area ok deck set arm right place hi fi deck ability move arm backwards forward gauge allows set side parallel one important thing anti skate dial point side turntable studio easily pick uncut acetate place turntable put stylus skate towards center side point perfect balance difficult think press people set turntable thing look whether headshell orientate correctly whether cartridge vertical record issue like whether arm high whether tilt forward backwards technically need oscilloscope tone one generally bit trial error spend time patient see find best sound u familiar go nightclub see stantonortofons maybe like shure stylus design really hold groove loud look stylus listen record home high quality would recommend stylus stanton use linear frequency response frequency record come right level lot quite lot dj cartridge bass rise midrange cut strange top nothing wrong work sound reference purpose use actually wiring arrangement agree rewire cartridge actually one back studio direct stanton rewire do especially look sell product spherical elliptical stylus whiteboard come go whiteboard bit lesson groove sound cut system put music stylus fine edge fine frequency response go high indeed stylus play back idea get everything back groove something strange happens record explain take enlargement groove give high frequency view record groove view high frequency movement one wall groove center line point bottom wall groove like draw three curve parallel line sort wall see microscope go draw two show difference people say tell record study groove spherical stylus dj stylus basically mean tip round round tip place groove draw circle bend three line clearly cannot go groove big ride top elliptical stylus shape like see small diameter edge go groove monitor top end output record graph draw upside record actually brighter cleaner play elliptical stylus another thing record people realize outside move quite lot faster inside record spin record deck movement fast whereas go inside actually slow groove slow go towards label one best form music hear effect house tune big hi hat ten minute long spread across record first three quarter record sound fine last bit hi hat drop level general grunginess sound start increase back board return whiteboard imagine slice cake center hole record outside edge move fast waveform outside edge spread quite large distance cut waveform center shape squash imagine squeeze box concertina squeeze box outside edge spread arm wide inside edge push back together record player find difficult play point narrow wave point wide wave thing happens difference technically well speed know scratch dj love always well opinion think keep customer happy well technically well recognize scratch certain form music avoid especially long side forty five really work eight half minute get beyond amount space shrink lot longer side tend often need compensate look top end test cut make sure close get cut need penny top headshell make sit groove draw line quest loudness clarity overdo common sense level work tend use lot people rely release date expect one cut press work expect tie tour whatever lot time experiment level push level lot thing louder cut less record player play back problem return lot jungle tune find way play weight stylus bass energy general power get groove nice loud sometimes practical go far obviously passionate vinyl sure many u well apart major release actually dance culture dj culture hip hop keep vinyl culture alive hip hop dance go see favorite dj actually play vinyl play serato cd lot genre vinyl simply bought sell anymore put tune together unless radiohead someone know afford luxury make loss incentive release vinyl day certainly understand financial implication think creative satisfaction spending lot time energy work tune get even small run vinyl great way get music interestingly enough vinyl still trade ebay good price good tune good tune people buy sell record ebay really lose value good tune always vinyl think resurgence interest lot vinyl band like sound three minute energy come record think band view colour vinyl whatever promotional novelty oppose actual format use necessarily see anything wrong view novelty fact produce good sound record novelty worn least still available record label spend press record spend two grand advert last one week magazine kind understand priority type situation work lot artist whose record label release vinyl come money want certain prestige vinyl well move digital realm tell importance sample rate sample near equivalent film frame film snapshot look way snapshot happen sample per second sample accurate sample sample basically come period year year lot people work cd hear put cd yes yes sound horrible limitation real sound maybe another picture return whiteboard take real life five sound hear room stand front drum kit saxophone player five look analog era good microphone good mix desk decent cut get something like four go high resolution digital somewhere around three four mean dynamic range record system sample rate sample per second digital good analog one end point five cd somewhere draw one two clever amount information come great historically go somewhere much well tune people rave old tune soul four term record limit sample system able get four approximation encourage client work high sample rate wherever possible master cd retain high sample rate end session sample cd way master cd stay master studio stay least equipment sample practical purpose file storage use lot digital outboard gear get sample stay practical issue much gear around outboard world work high sample rate around moment one bit sacd mhz huge huge sample rate completely different technical system pcm pulse code modulation sacd interest one invite abbey road studio listen pioneer development sony huge back catalog material much deteriorate decide invent system fast sample could sample analog stuff without worry lose anything lot test invite abbey road live band play super audio recorder half inch tape machine invite compare listen two system sound like sony kind refine use system archive material go right backmetalwork stuff engineer around globe archive vast amount material store form product super audio cd put really take much sony perhaps thought would nevertheless alternative option pyramix audio workstation record sacd work audio already bit point end session asks bounce bit good question actually find room equipment set bit like sound like system bit careful throw dither noise digital record change tonality sound much dither add change sound keep system bit dither automatically general rule always work high sample rate use bit yes work k master last couple year much pleasurable experience hearing detail energy well engineer session recently someone italy revert back work surprised much like start remind come point master loud possible laugh know studio call loud ought call loud enough lead question lot talk call loudness war new metallica album think arctic monkey loudness always work mot√∂rhead stuff know mot√∂rhead get loud look way engineer produce material put tape needle vu would go plus one actually stay move level limit compression could almost line tape machine use mot√∂rhead tape much loudness think loudness kind subjective thing loudness hammer something limiter well record piece information sound loud without necessarily loud try offer client scale someone brings record sound quiet look meter listen comparison say oi carl cd eight db quieter need want think asks bumped get realm far bump look music aim track full pelt need maximum volume point make entire track level look far push take away actual design track first place always use analogue gear first preference digital gear get much much well sound compression sound natural comparison dr mika stuff think compression do analog tends give big wider fatter version start clipped unlistenable people approach literally hit digital limiter hard everything mash heard people say tune mix case much percent master tricky one recording little thing think master make quite big difference vibe vibe record track sometimes get bit lose sometimes vinyl cd master nudge vibe back sound sometimes bit strange sometimes choose signal path get analog limiter sound certain way know put hip hop automatically sound way sound authentic big wider bit rougher correctly master stuff enhance end day lot people hear go buy stuff really know master record think master take anything away people contributes enormous amount year ago goldfrapp first album alison come pile dat idea really want say get start bit compression say want compression say let something prepared everything master everything give take away say wow fantastic left hardly change anything influence approach lot project see begin master help get record ground put actually mystery magic know involve mix record give magic think thing say listen something make sound hundred time strong fatter big word put lot emphasis individual bit equipment sound like choose workstation run sonic solution system always use system make endless comparison still find sound big wider strong clearer sonic solution first people planet put digital file audio file onto computer another system use video industry actually pioneer sound tool lot system come something way relate start good workstation basically use play material whatever sample rate number signal path either digitally analog give certain sound texture use lot valve equipment recent stuff get device call manley slam analog limiter get interest digital probably warm digital transfer device get really thick manual lot abstract blurb go design actual chip use nagra equipment listen stuff get tape machine sit quite often part session place stuff tape see sound like kind wow moment people sit really know expect put onto tape listen see lke whole row face light like wow know hit something sometimes put something tape give couple perceivable extra db without anything people say go see engineer go mad yeah need anything gonna pick choose use ear process record choice microphone thing let listen example yeah get bauhaus actually hit bauhaus yet record company time time reissue early material technology around much much well retrieve information tape involve remastering lot ad beggar banquet recording people like gary numan cocteau twin bauhaus bigbrought bauhaus remaster show vinyl remastering engineer get original cd version recent transfer music bauhaus double dare original cd version remastered vinyl version play tape enormous amount weight record play tape monitor sound heavy listen cd doneweight completely miss much thinner electronic sound try get well snapshot come tape get contemporary electronic music know cut lot stuff bristol jungle guy house hip hop everything rush come really time afters honest stuff brought kind interested recent pj harvey exactly bristol jungle kind demonstrate certain thing music pj harvey dear darkness cut cd vinyl version thought quite interest get one client sit room right mr pritchard mark work john right yeah reckon since maybe eight year maybe longer would interest know stage deliver track obviously live sydney john west england make work process go back forth one big worry move sydney able access john easily learn much go studio hearing thing luckily ftp site mix track normally upload server john take server maybe call something mix quite right speak think may problem generally really happy john thing upload server take check album do nail maybe first time two three track another go maybe another couple another go two three attempt john thing listen live bit play track certain track stand quite varied album take lot time get balance right track like long process john moan lot middle mark discover stem instead send mixed track sends sub mix maybe three four pair open lot possibility could deal say bass separately main track actually end think work stem make much well sound record use lot take drum bass bass vocal lot pass engineer would traditionally upload ftp file talk maybe mb song upload maybe eight ten version john get take thing thought well instead stem basic simple element track reliant bass put bass bass least problem say kick drum bass relationship want bass john limited point go add bass maybe kick heavy always limitation get separately allows push bass without affect kick kick bit weak put bass kick without affect bassline stem sound well master soon listen track bass listen two together sound well everything together way sonic solution would play back sense stage like element mix master thing always type engineer embrace kind add ons back exchange rory gallagher guitarist want add guitar part cut record come roadie set di box rig bit mixer put power chord live cut record historically vinyl root live recording film set studio would literally cut live wax vinyl actually use later tape come along people would think origin vinyl instantaneous record medium look oldcop movie state se couple detective big hat stand around disc cut machine tap phone conversation disc cut big place world time see question master mark get tune go see get would depress would give good indication even get would good play something one question people ask point work track end best often mp low think well work high sample rate think low sample rate go around forever think faster high data transfer rate people get fed file barely sound alright way record tape clearer issue people come vinyl dat tape era might get fed people start listen music ear train listen horrible file persuade get bore hearing think personal realization thing people want embrace high quality sound fine choice think listen experience something quite important go backradio station everything do medium vinyl quite powerful energy people listen music way different lot diversity people talk favorite music whereas back people tend follow kind music lot poetry song lot message obviously political stuff get across part happen sound work sit studio listen temptation record everyone go wow listen sound well record mp start sit go wow something original master good know go go film company might want use track fantastic recording would work really well high sample rate use world dvd personal choice back mark question mark use go end low end day work degree separation sound much well resolution mean hear everything mix want also power energy vinyl power energy high sample rate power energy record feel whether move way perhaps mp world left mp think something vital would lose would run sort parallel world art look painting artist quite happily paint canvas hundred year say canvas make paint computer would happen world art audio audio bit strange dream buying camera few picture available young cinema experience widescreen fantastic compare watch kind five inch digital thing sit hand experience audio people work high fidelity sound may able deliver future think happen think lose opportunity people work form heard sound like output work really worth compare input output worth probably afford wonder suggestion people like u need work probably computer would certainly advise compare like whatever else even advise even start track put information system finish recording try work like make work apply description every sound bright harsh sound okay flat say record sound couple db quieter want instance bit l amplify absolutely fine type master get involve people want radically move recording away people actually know do expand use think aware world get money least make sure get sound right throughout record mix need nudge nudge budget master service engineer stick stuff sequoia simple level task client perfectly happy andy mckay roxy music come time time do reality could get good monitor good meter confidence nudge thing sometimes need much budget service unattended album whole album yeah time limited jason good work within workstation palette choice quite limited room gear really extreme really within workstation basically happy get want tidy two question first one wonderful lecture aspect deal sound master master process still bit mystery still seem like magic know sound well define master sentence impossible sentence two sentence ok presentation choice presentation go whole process computer digital computer lack something people call warmth personality get hold simply something experience something part personality way hearing listen much cable many different bit equipment make choice say one use cable people come respect choice know go get roughly ballpark want master engineer take different approach presentation present product general consumption either functional creative make creative decision people say ok finish mix tune want present world want master true quite lot people people couple album get feedback people everyone say actually album quiet decide master next time creative decision would define get song present level everything else world explain simple way view say get album ten track string together may relate play enjoy give someone listen kitchen car whatever keep jumping adjust volume track track may think ok may decide ok take grant buy cd put player listen performance start begin finish end one guy make sure journey right kind journey stuff people do virtually unlistenable cannot experience music fully would master properly track sound good need master five ten percent fit bracket rest need kind help one thing studio flat response reference monitoring system work set say instance work nsreputation slightly bright may hearing right top end response mix room come master record dull bass problem people start use n would standard k eq boost bit trim bottom end tidy way view sometimes master engineer professional chain especially work lot record label like idea least someone listen release pick stuff pick bad edits bad sample edits click glitch within track perhaps people heard phone someone say loop click say mean look system sure enough step waveform put spotlight magnify glass listen every split second quite weird lead second question talk much clarity precision sound think lot great music create unprofessionalism yeah really take grant hear thing lot great track great hear end day good performance prefer people literally make music quickly problem watch spend hour hour fiddle beat second section track get patience would go spontaneous approach guy spend time prepare track give musician say give u performance hear track lot american house tune real piano player play really decent stuff lot people repeat loop stuff like rule term creativity want whether satisfied three year line one listen could well miss opportunity competitive radio station tend play stuff pop get notice talk listen every split second record talk lp experience guy decides much space track magic two second art art yes ever get artist say much space yes actually think gap album quite important get psyche somehow know gap beat come trevor put legend album together get obsess gap held entire project one big sell cd time maybe gap help think probably subtle though talk monitor make atc company west england power monitor call scm a suit room work fill room easy hear miniscule change one tenth db change try monitor found heard less plus minus two db across whole range kind like giant nearfield monitor scour website like atc monitor say prefer use analog gear sometimes get digital would drive digital couple thing control top end receive record sound bit dull need general top end lift amongst might vocal suddenly become bit somewhere panel become aware something weird happen pleasant nip vice unit gently de still retain top end want add useful tool sometimes need use limiter maybe output maybe one db limit get choice limiter get stc finalizer sort different device actually sound slightly different choose something level sometimes sound well level louder go whether something detail use know may like pick thing need good energy start may use limiter selective time remind another question thing use put clamp record live performance often get feedback turntable clamp cause try try know let say recession hit hard people decide master recording survive sell studio gear three piece gear studio would keep lathe want move yeah yeah wonderful piece equipment keep half inch tape machine wonderful piece equipment else probably keep monitor could listen home stuff enjoy thanks lecture learn lot already mention press vinyl also change sound lose bit quality right happen yes anticipate master music try project press quite strange thing steve winwood album island lot synths album high synths delicate overtone press come back factory go remove high frequency fine small frequency record factory polish metalwork take cloth actually polish high frequency recut add little bit high top second test press come back still lose third cut go berserk add load come back alright sometimes midrange peak feedback sound sound okay acetate soft acetate cut soft bend slightly weight stylus press soft rigid rigid groove throw problem really aware heard engineer cut room spray lacquer coolant try harden try mimic press do mention also master music destine play club house jungle club people around scream yell able tell dj play mp vinyl make think work nothing nice get good record play accept fact people choose play thing think important thing whoever release record feel play vinyl release come vinyl still dancefloor tell difference mp vinyl people could ask point great master go back source file club go people club think care job think place hear difference accept isolated place hear difference mark stuff come file guarantee hear difference get one mark track master actually like little musical interlude get wicked track call returners forthcoming harmonic warp recording november laugh music harmonic returners master applause understand want move sydney question hi get track start master certain routine go go certain bit equipment first listen get feel thing ought kind telepathy go master people send stuff something might record colombia australia say know exactly want pick approach maybe couple approach sometimes give people choice franz ferdinand album moment lot unattended really know exactly want give maybe couple db difference level brief job hammer level everything want part loudness war take everything steady dynamic turn session get louder aware want push sometimes totally sure want couple thing happens give choice back customer may use one download one cd vinyl set way finite amount equipment room go back loudness question mainly pop music everyone try make song loud possible music get compress see thing like five year difficult one think two thing go high level stuff especially want hottest band block like liter water put one liter water liter bottle cd digital ceiling one way people get music notice find clever way compress limit crank whole sound thrash grunge band heavy metal whatever part sound problem aware record natural maximum level sometimes take little work sometimes something perhaps leave day back decide loud common first instinct think come work vinyl go slightly louder thing rein back little bit like window rein back far becomes less interest sound reverbs go background kind impact window work try work within window say five ten percent material receive would need master always case change sincechanged quite lot first start studio remember receive lotrecordings one one copy master come like track album job splice copy together complete utter surprise sound fine level change require everything work level think come everybody training record engineer fairly formal training equipment design work certain way vu meter tape machine people work roughly zero dolby unit noise reduction unit take away tape hiss work certain level production staff whatever music actually less finish master mix thing happen custom master exist make record actually sent factory would put cut master come believe start less state people realize could little bit first studio work trident cut room main building department large studio abbey road cut room decca change lot introduction digital studio workstation lack use big record studio wrap would really valuable get rus elevado involve yesterday talk musician performance mix performance anyone alters afterwards longer baby want anyone touch mix engineer expect master process rus elevado good question get mix point work hour hour expect master engineer really listen first see sound album start normal chain especially stuff standard style mix anymore everything loud compress really linear really want mine louder everybody else want dynamic stay go sort tweak touch low touch high pull middle little bit would normally expect master engineer album plus like put l anything believe end put digital compressor run mix vintage equipment involve therefore artist master stage rus elevado do full album even half city definitely go session pretty much master master engineer use two people start use john met laugh whole time artist come like stay involve master make sure mess mix mess mix pull whole db certain frequency master engineer experienced could really ruin whole vision album concept get question though process bring level cd standard make louder standard way bring cd standard computer processing get level personally stand change level digital domain come try thing time time remember long time ago acoustic album need five db gain seven eight place system could change gain exactly six db thought see happens set one would thought theoretically mathematically would end six file sound exactly horror file sound totally incoherent fall apart others sound harsh one bad point realize string number dodgy source studio whether half inch digital within reason play flat come digital quite often converter like sound sound digitize musical tend level change analog present converter correct level cd go onto workstation workstation edit fade present material whatever medium go store cd end thing possibly workstation occasionally put little bass filter plug something pop mix occasionally get thump drum kit maybe fancy level adjustment rather awkward crossfade something would say engineer percent level adjustment already do time get destination workstation already zero go high level set generally discussion client see project amongst everyone else people go dynamic want kick quite lot uk hip hop compare serious dr dre level stuff want go home rethink time push level otherwise sound like mean anything level right depends genre dynamic aside classical engineer come say want stuff touch already peak zero put system transfer digitally change sat listen say might peak zero sound db quieter anything else want big kind brain strain think oh god get change sound five db still sound like less originally end result quite big approach minimalist way skill rus elevado pro world zero vu cd relative zero vu pro world zero vu normally minus cd scale different institution different people slight variation reason see drum beat peak zero vu meter electronic level could db high huge difference way peak meter read sound digital workstation use standard vu meter switch give different set one last one cristian vogel people feel call become master engineer inevitably aspect engineering learn eq become interested talk delicate approach science art master recommend budding master engineer train learn master year hardly ever get meet others talk different approach really intrigue hear school standard way learn come across school think one day end write book couple book bob katz bit piece think learn experience way record learn experience privilege come industry time learn experience huge able look forward look backwards apply sensible engineering technique bring best learn past current best experience get place actually master different engineer definitely respect term work sit use audio workstation pas single sound yet respect work definitely slightly style thing suppose really introduce place even ask whether couple day make tea help get people come quite lot sit around day get bit boring come day client laugh generally involve like idea stuff go onto tape lathe get excite generally ok around rest day right people get question sure ask lunch high tea whatever relevant time thanks master mr john dent
