would restore proper command could name save restore result pulse address action could store presets particular concert stage able include different design one box mean way start particular model could follow like today go oh yeah want model something like want program something follow example start much simple basic technology idea another way think possibility within create sound electronically use word artificially well begin roughly actually do electronic sound mostly aid tape recorder know tape composer tape compose essence great grandfather sample guess yeah go back long way work synthesis time mark rca much earlier instrument take look picture particular moment know orson welles war world something thought oh something else sound symphonic orchestra initial key moment go whoa want knew pretty early even sound concréte say use tape recorder create unheard sound played backwards splice strange way age tape recording one thing always surprised talk phase stockhausens french people contrary let say yesterday guy london year old already veteran scene go back time see load people already mature intricate really seem like serious honest man occupation create artificial music agree seriousness look serious picture lot fun day still hang grateful dead ken kesey acid test tripslot fun well guess know yeah ken kesey tom wolfe describe interest thing

tape music center bottom original one still mill college oakland california offer take basically ring modulator understand correctly lot different module ring modulation one several process bit hand make design ring modulator lot easy right yes yes come built good balance modulator knowledge never study electronics picked lot building project nasa go mum go look get crazy ring modulator like tell laugh demonstrate would happen would get kind strange ring modulate sound would sound sorry hum tune laugh another interest thing era produce sound also technology take different place like downstairs example limiter compressor thing us photo cell understand guy use lot early photo technology well create sound case yes first moment one would think lightning sound explain little bit us photo cell would creation sound well lightning come much later optical length need transmitter consist lead receptor consist silicon diode talk may technique use early gate still use technique optic coupler us lead cadmium selenide cell closely couple far apart envision happen load guy white suit big mask everything dust free set work even clean room lot closer repair old car possibly yeah maybe solder radio car work bench modern instrument help develop thing time still less tinker around less hobbyist level right never much hobbyist would paraphrase developed relatively sophisticated design think model happy design design usually first take production model design panel design createdstill built originally design use production time go lot prototyping stage talk baby day analogue synthesis use musician always interest day people opposite end world might similar thing obviously people research similar way create art electric sound part america hear first others perhaps heard bob moog first synthesizer almost time one u work west coast aesthetic robert moog work east coast totally different aesthetic strangely built similar module interconnection philosophy quite different view competition initially think yes become good friend merge many operation design moog equipment fact much later ignore ten year laugh stage work similar thing different approach industry yet speak clear indication money make always fringe activity need go work others include nasa sometimes synthesizer manufacturer design earn keep come first synthesizer relatively together almost within year give speed time mediation event almost time take could explain pretty fundamental difference approach lead u main subject guess interface human machine interaction let see think primary difference approach separate audio signal control signal fact use two different kind quartz even present synthesizer robert moog could take call balance modulators ring modulator use gate break dc could take audio oscillator program sub audio oscillator case turn control could use something else system capability want high performance possible want ring modulator extremely low leakage extremely high signal noise work gate would offset signal zero reference oscillate reference control voltage different range zero somewhere range totally different two system moog jack signal headroom system work require headroom would relatively small might two volt amplitude could go volt amplitude difference control quite different input level audio signal control pot know exponential audio taper control moog equipment linear disadvantage make one disadvantage one simple conceptual disadvantage look complex patch look lot wire tell one handle signal one handle control voltage really one give u idea cabinet modular system size stage cabinet three module high gesture hand module seven inch high would multiple four quarter inch wide four quarter sub division width fit inch rack well nobody ever use rack mount system chose four quarter seven format chosen format use even currently many sound would get complex patch size great number sound one time may use overdubbing awful lot sound one time could use live performance without aid tape digital processing anything listen morton subotnick earlier work silver apple moon first one commission nonesuch make approximately believe us much overdubbing use two revox reel reel tape machine one broken channel record one pretty intact one much mean resource tape bounce anything like another interest aspect take also include sequencer early form want go even maybe even grandfather mpc way well think thought sequencer stage could eliminate tape splice still tape thing four level people start use rhythmic thing terry riley make great use sequencer

get kind distribution shape white noise actually kind normally hearing white kind tricky circuit wise make call flat noise system flat noise plus db noise call know white noise actually db term energy per octave db sound like bassy white noise easy generate flat noise difficult make think one incorporate flat noise system also best one filter get equal bass treble noise use white noise orient

missile would get little skewed knew peck would regulate would operate valve move pin thing direct mechanical linkage electronics involve pigeon steer missile directly towards thing strange mean actually work do florida never actually hit big time system function night enemy forgot light city enemy could see range limited optic project far certainly interest experiment pigeon doom raise great turmoil everywhere lose thousand people overseas loss pigeon consider bad form next slide let move onto another one bio robotic system three wheel contraption essentially steer beetle show mechanism particular beetle operating ping pong ball underneath sensor determine way run ball turn captivate system little bracket wing tie firmly bracket fast pedal move direction peddle initiate bunch light see around front particular light light hate light particular guy photo entropic something like back ping pong ball gear somehow operates servo mechanism operating wheel beetle light come device approach wall obstacle beetle back slow vehicle amuse watch vehicle move around control photo entropic beetle cockroach like controller every would go totally control beetle would right thing run wall something like reduce practical application job next slide oh yeah another one want show still subject animal hamster simple idea row represent first pitch dynamic three voice polyphonic synthesizer three voice played top two middle two bottom two hamster run back forth different thing happen different voice inaudible comment audience oh know one explain u know much inaudible comment audience well explain gut think enough let end unless question seem like art like really get production thing show like demo become like final product end think like use knowledge medical purpose instead like see artist tend work studio performer almost piece involve stag set ups crazy thing kind nutty idea people go interact people interact audience like admire producer sound concern detail concern detail performance piece different like experiment every time like well thank applause
