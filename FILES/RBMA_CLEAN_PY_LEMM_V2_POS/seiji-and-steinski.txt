think would well talk technical thing rather embarrass studio sure probably use reason think people surprised find make majority music cubase atari midi commodore computer produce sound include synth sound chop vocal put sample kind thing whereas steve get everything protools obviously common theme agree seem sort obsession gear technology neither u seem feel way think one thing happen work new york metropolitan area lot guy grown world technical music make work studio grabbed onto protools learn use protools system whole lot plug in fine work great course constantly meeting guy say go get protools hd right well really reason sample k know dog hear want spend another box allows people say protools go get osx like well reinvest plug in also learn osx go get g thing work people logical next step must fact matter really think must one buying record buying record go buy oh man listen sample k poo else get logical sensible consumerist attitude towards like play guitar need learn play guitar well guitar go help learn well necessarily string closer fretboard might little easy learn change thing need part need practice need learn need know thoroughly one thing seem good area chat urge upgrade urge move next version becomes end like say think consumerist attitude get completely lose really end end skim surface capability software talk music try make really caught wrong aspect sit think great use make well beat make vocal sinuous whatever would like simplifies everything get new thing think becomes distraction especially confident term production easy get distract actually belief newer thing help get problem confront least case found relatively rare new thing help get generally present half dozen problem good distraction thing try solve first place know book say must preset work correctly blah blah blah four hour later lose whatever idea originally try go caught back alley software point want make would like address actually found upgrade new equipment present problem feel like lose way little bit last year struggle get use new technology bit useless computer generally really struggle logic could maybe come red bull academy take course something move logic know regret leave atari behind become obsolete tactile easy use software use logic find stuck intellectual problem overcome feel away able instantly make music actually next couple year look buy many ataris find get good work order store break put next one use also sample side experiment try use thing like ex battery stuff like found able hand instrument audition button go click click click feel like somehow touch sound make really work well use recycle chop everything laziness thing found bit diligent chop everything hand lot creativity come creative process chop something hand result accident happen hear thing break hear thing sample hear put recycle get chop definitely lot say old school method work think part efficient new thing much find lot melodic loop melodic line drum another couple channel drum sort fit sort yeah suppose could use version recycle occurs pro tool beat detective separate everything like snap finger like use exactly reason paul talk sit cut move shift thing around little bit manner possibility seem come oh actually sound well hair behind oh could get rid would fine becomes part creative process definitelysoul jazz music lot really suffer kind kind need upgrade new sound everyone move time wonderful soundsanalog gear wentgreat hero soul start use horrible horrible synthesizer sound think roland preset crystal rhodes probably big offender result whole decade music almost become really horribly unlistenable get caught current big sound go back listen year later go think oh god awful get fever like wow gonna hit like easy say painter brush brush contribute much choose software still issue matter learn get comfortable end would like might extra step involve less efficient think fine think really great music innovative sound come people push technology available want either back day technology advanced situation people budget mean really want get sound closest approximation use equipment get end come something brand new sound really crazy something say big piece gear work push far go bob moog stand oh mr moog possibly tell laugh want comment painter versus brush business far everything say wonder go say tomorrow say true even though put u engineer work laugh never never yes brush matter brush matter extent comfortable use idea flow brush beyond whatever painting nobody hold brush say brush everybody painting much case happy work protools much point know copious spare time sit go well know familiar midi part work let hook couple virtual synthesizer see get happen sudden find oh know get arpeggiated bassline tell range work like oh smoking okay alright sound little mechanical bounce track mess digital edit stuff wonderful want keep move end ever get end keep move away little bit next function sell people protools time forget software people front microphone instrument may seem like best convenient thing lot record like make technical stuff whatsoever except couple microphone tape machine really hot drummer really good bass player get caught technical aspect thing blind alley criticism listener like electronic music like human touch music perhaps way get become familiar equipment really becomes like real instrument really constantly change technology get feel becomes something directly express start use reason recycle instance make beat realize sound like beat anyone could do particular signature sound completely disappear alex phountzi bugz attic say yeah recycle like pre chopped carrot audience laughter good ingredient feel much technology limit try method formedmaybe right instance look kid grow technology use computer way would probably never would able age might completely different maybe kid go close technology like instrument fingertip fantastic speak part generation fall gap bit computer around grow everywhere society interested program anything sort caught try make music traditional way come classical background well play cello maybe approach make electronic music one thing idea lot technology around order make music easy unless extremely strong vision go really understand stuff available easy become bogged choice could often one end nothing circumstance nothing happens take tentative step really one well exercise friend mine would get together every week bring six sample anything say go make song afternoon always great say liberate fact worry let get another snare sound right snare sound work gonna great really right thing like say necessarily turn great work exercise like scale figure use get front feel way really found remixing start remixing found really easy already limit could use get lose endlessly search next sample get work get make best kind similar limited one piece gear get piece gear like work set range sample get sample get push milk everything kind make remixing fun do couple remixes wonderful piece melodic line want use hard work already do come grand concept sort do creative seed already bob moog stand like everybody know extremely unlikely read anything like magazine simple reason magazine exist serve advertiser reader serve advertiser one pay bill something suggest need late whizzbang advertiser good way lose advertiser magazine even really good one think twice remember ever reading kind wisdom guy accord afternoon worry state musician press today get back case work technology someone listens guy today might look like knock technology think meant sometimes upgrade software find need stuff sort upgrade old software get feel assure right feel one way must say worship technology hate use available make music context make young hand cello get certain age culture social situation involve music surround make music technology really good thing bad thing emotional feeling towards technology either way good attitude least know technology know go necessarily buy achieve know amaze music make people lock studio see outside world five year think really keep late thing even know technology make good music say steve earlier almost get situation everyone use digital equipment everyone use logic plug in swap crack plug in like yeah get great plug sound like certain piece analog gear still available absolutely next nothing go look ebay seem bit back front like go get bit gear hook sample even use seem really ridiculous really long wind way go around get valve compressor sound know bit expensive make actually use real one sometimes emulation thing get access talk england portugal mellotron oh happy ok fair enough right come classic bit kit fair enough hear fantastic track madlib instance use bit kit obsolete even know emu sampler take road say worth listen music agree neither quality sound really thing production sound awful term mixdown analyze frequency go heavy vibe really matter
