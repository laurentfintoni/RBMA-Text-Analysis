either sk jungle jtc james cotton techno dance music general techno stuff hear yeah sure orgue electronique ep call garden influence music box ron hardy music orgue electronique garden james cotton remix applause long one idea though beat track tradition think beat track kind groove disco element long sort track really fun remix definitely mention inspire music box ron hardy let people know music box mean city ok maybe fourth generation know get story right deal basically disco house scene chicago warehouse party environment frankie knuckle dj ron hardy lot people thought ron hardy experimental little aggressive stuff lot edits drum machine workout stuff like ron hardy would play demo friend would bring club would actually play tape spot preview first like really frankie knuckle party basically collect tape tape recording tape stuff like get way ron hardy experimental term kind stuff would spin would spin lot style lot dirtier experimental basically remix say much original track well guess play really quick snip original element sort melodically bassline music orgue electronique garden track lot harder whole reimagining whole concept guess use sound anything like original track give source material basically try reflect melody string bassline really beat remix sort remake something heard ron hardy play one mix long drum machine sequence go little bit soul bury sound quiet little disco guitar really cool stuff like lot remix work yeah often actually create new track oppose use element original usually something like complete sort clean slate start little bit mean often remake people remixing like two track something way grab little snippet unless synth solo drum solo something anyway gear anyway might well try cover remake something yeah yeah definitely go new project new alias come pretty happy kind separate channel work far happy separate channel work far get four alias go lot collaborate project keep busy really much room anything else unless totally quit drop everything start something new tour extensively often home try tour much really enjoy tour long period time like tour like month time prefer dj notice night play seem like play vinyl case played cd brought unreleased stuff spun yeah collect vinyl still vinyl dj even overseas bring box become sort anachronism lot dj see vinyl anymore something important keep vinyl culture feel vinyl sound anything like something comfortable vinyl collect long time might well use run risk lose something get ruin lose lose transit like vinyl think fun format like large art work kind thing purist frown serato stuff like lot improvisation dj far blend song together go play order yeah improvise everything change base mood room kind stuff feel limited selection stuff brought bag able tailor successfully situation encounter situation fly people room get try convince people hear generally bring variety thing like lot different kind dance music kind stuff artist feel right people might know want check kind music style jeez listen lately oh man thing work use record store ann arbor buy record whatever time lately way disco like edwin birdsong course like lot thing ron hardy spin boogie train sorry blanking like lot different kind stuff like strictly listen particular music make like last cd bought armenian duduk zurna music depends people want work like jay dee stuff collaborator stuff todd osborn yeah want work laughter yeah want work guilty simpson special really fun always fan guilty simpson get powerful voice lot guy detroit really talented phat kat talk work together little something extra bbc black milk collaborate talk collaborate ta raach waajeed really happy people collaborate two three mc ridiculous work super good process aside work mc pretty cut dry make beat rhyme process work another beat maker producer collaborate situation funny every time say want collaborate someone say exactly think collaboration know say like lot different way could studio usually orphan incomplete track thing work basic sound beat mind really basic give flip vice versa difficult want work somebody familiar gear use start scratch usually something get kernel come add pipe right project forthcoming well get album come spectral name jtc james cotton call like one get lot acid techno house dabrye remix ep come soon feature fly lotus remix black milk remix kode remix exclusive track ag call get dirty pipeline right work new york guy ag different pretty detroit centric different mean guy probably big reputation detroit people work history respect new york rap get different real easy fun process set different alias like ok feel ebm right let track come name later yeah latter whatever feel studio whatever mood automatically already alias whatever go kind music even call something track name album name really come later mind concerned fact really even like think thing like song name alias name stuff like seem common factor dance music get inspiration lock mushroom room try though really common factor space get really inspire something sometimes need get right mood certain genre get deadline come need make dabrye album something like throw something little close hip hop try play much hip hop want start subconsciously pick someone style get influence get dabrye mode think play afrobeat ethiopian funk like mahmoud ahmed know example try get mode jtc track play old disco patrick adam ok name drop ridiculous try play people directly close really focus especially day age lot people make music lot people release label stuff lot young inspire talent try consciously distinguish people might something similar right one three come artist start thing sound really similar try say influence anything like concerned make sure challenge maybe even get influence try predictable hope answer question first become aware dabrye stuff mini album instrmntl really love still play time day go ask sort one three exclusively instrumentals two three heavy mcing premeditate thing felt like establish sound let people mic yet sort rep cachet get people latter yeah latter basically although like say really way dj pns fresh produce instrumental mix tape special interest instrumental hip hop way even like trip hop downtempo mo wax stuff whatever lot interested rugged strip sound instrumental hip hop let see happen time know mc basically knew want work thought best thing situation well might well put instrumental album let world resume mc want work anyway ask mc work like ok already release luckily many case mc already hip make thing lot easy one question ok also two three obviously get interdisciplinary alias seem change even amongst dabrye stuff two three earlier stuff ear anyway lot less reliant sample mention like sample clearance feel increase problem get sample clear profile rise think inhibit find inspire move different direction yeah start sell lot record little bit worried much flip sample although use sample new music previous album maybe sound little sample orient maybe little layer sample yeah get little concerned basically try sample thing even obscure thing way radar sample music obviously like local group never see light day hopefully even like sample real bad music one would even think go might find like two second something really nice generally terrible muzak album something like different thing avoid worry clearing regard separate project differentiate go work assume get point start something necessarily intend kind maybe cater towards one project work meter ok definitely intend something else maybe use instrument set line barrier like well go use project sound certain way limit think studio really limited anyway easy limit let instrument well see crossover use maybe funky warm sort sound lead dabrye track would normally use maybe synth line bassline jtc track really genrefying happens sort automatically generally make hip house anything could anywhere dabrye jtc really like keep sound separate automatically easy thing kind fall line naturally alright alright hear one jungle track definitely one call da police yeah music soundmurderer sk call da police applause thank
