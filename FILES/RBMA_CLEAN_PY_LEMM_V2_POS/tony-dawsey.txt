change back fundamental concept less technology would say anything technology stand still first startedmasterdisk probably music come quarter inch tape either ip ip know ip stand inch per second year later become half inch half inch tape half inch tape digital age come f beta vhs tape get involve open reel digital come play year later cd come play change quite bit sincekinds digital computer play term people record mix music onto technology obviously change lot far approach change back say earlier feel master ice cake get project anybody take give wannatry make little well room constitutes good sound good sound record estimation think important everything clean bass wise like bass tight punchy muddy tubby speak like top end open airy mid range nice crisp also truth record create equal sound well others sure one bad thing engineer go somebody come tape sound good tell make sound like one well sound record market thing people come tell make sound like dr dre record make sound like jay z record something like easy easy say polish yeah little say polish turd come sound somewhere ballpark go get work like want play anything far cite example know describe sound maybe play demonstrate thing little clearly people would ask format like master still really prefer half inch ip dynamic open love know digital age always cost sufficient lot people come dat cd computer file simple cheap best sound record feel still do half inch new technology expensive people use one inch tape lucky enough work kelly price last album first record master one inch tape incredible incredibly dynamic incredibly clean eq record much somehow find amaze couple diffeent little thing want play let know feel something dynamic jay z record master half inch ip noise reduction tape play piece cut let see dynamic music jay z change game bob head beat love bass love sorry help see nod bit throughout session matter jazz r b whatever love bass like bass sound like else want say particular track example find ideal love stuff dynamic range low octave bass yet still lot top end good record mix master job brought though already sound decent like say really say sort maximize already want play anything else music jay z wannalove u give music jay z excuse miss well back day back earlyforth golet say album come half inch tape normally do one engineer one studio perhaps one producer consistent across board day album track could seven different producer could do ten different studio across country make little bit challenge get consistent across board say mix create equal seem big challenge day master engineer try get project bit consistent track track severe sort example real disparate sound one record maybe remember addition engineer well others studio well others may boost one track couple db top end next track may boost four db keep synch one lot challenge sure definitely think music lot consistent one studio one format one engineer speak hip hop era concern seem like lot hip hop album example live instrumentation also severe sort issue deal yeah run problem people ask come track sound good track know well track mixed well track track mixed good studio one sometimes people understand r people record company people understand stuff job make happen hell get get little consistent person know come would work always producer artist person one four normally somebody record company come sometimes one engineer project come make sure stuff right sometimes artist come producer come wide range different people sometimes room ten different people everybody want best project sure love ten different people laugh well easy everybody want stuff sound right okay want common difficult sometimes think try please ten different people sometimes impossible get nine people happy way track sound get one person say want bell louder something like little crazy time part get make best hand experience far producer whoever artist work wow funny probably name quite know guy like dj premier start session end much hand involve everything tellin make suggestion reggie noble another one premier reggie noble come know go five six morning unfortunately master record reggie run street real quick get sound effect skit something reggie noble know public redman thing go say consistent thing know guy come certain way definitely hip hop

good sound good get vibe little taste jay z like record sound go play record sell million copy united state come sound good go see difference dis person find probably never go work record big record like say sell million copy forth listen music sound like get vibe get jay z record music kid rock cowboy long go try get place could satisfied say normally eq track happy people room happy say listen three five time something like course eq record get sound good take little bit longer longer session take lot time session standard obviously come bother million record purchaser client say cool happy mean eq something people room play beforehand play eq right people andy karp come r guy lava record like say play record flat output console eq hear difference right happy record mean saw long ago talkin guy put bass record forth smile quite way would like sound course record create equal try master every record sound like jay z record notice rap little bit well jay z album laugh could do hear say help aspect record nah get involve speak people laugh far hip hop thing go professional industry well let ask first career predates hip hop somewhat far bring something different table hear thing different ear work hip hop record oppose genre kind funny backstarted equalize record master record forth lot rock roll time lot heavy metal point lot jazz happens get name record sell lot copy everybody want part back first album la bamba soundtrack audience laugh know something totally different year start da efx redmans stuff like course lot record sell well people gravitate want part thing engineer hate get kind categorize put mode like type music honest probably surprised know home relaxin chillin listen group call fourplay love music album daughter constantly say dad listen fourplay say baby get eight album lot music listen audience laugh love type stuff music listen really reflection mood go listen fourplay album yes little dr dre whatever depends mood really far standard hip hop sound different bring something different work another genre approach exact way approach music different really regardless type take people give record mix session want try make sound little well long time bring certain amount experience table instantly play something back room go uh need little boost top end start work notice bass need big boost immediately attack different approach one type music another really know yeah say record create equal know producer hip hop particularly know grimy sound somebody like wu tang rza one people experience work do record earlier absolutely right griminess play record club go obvious sonic difference play record definitely right know do purpose engineer equipment use rza wu tang clan record definitely bit grimy nice tight punchy bass love much lot people feel sound style tell do purpose sure way turn think thing heard kid rock record versus jay z think everybody want sound record sound good possible nice tight punchy bass nice open top end crisp mids always happen way unfortunately know work rap people different challenge far etiquette go sometimes probably elaborate couple example name name particular example particularly egregious come think gonna professional prepared maybe turn way laugh guess first thing obvious deal guess happens hip hop music people time normally start day clock quite people would show three four clock kind rough term life planning thing afterwards business like say day normally start clock lucky end eight ten clock many instance three four five clock morning remember early day work dj premier maybe something work try kind rush little bit work rush go play pool get phone make phone call learn make plan work take song time know people particularly memorable far like studio jay z ever show master session mean follow artist far process pretty much delegate responsibility point really depends individual think work last five jay z record first time met work first dmx album come say hi show little support five album do come last one one suppose retire business come guess make sure thing okay good thing show retire otherwise might never see right laugh exactly normally depend somebody get job do whether r person engineer one producer forth different everybody sometimes artist come oversee project always depend record company person almost always good thing bad thing mind work people really creative atmosphere problem nice room check website comfortable masterdisk feed clientele pool table conference room table computer try make comfortable people easygoing guy want make record sound best possibly far length session go time say yesterday specific preference probably make lot sense far start day want elaborate little bit definitely wannamaster record four clock morning human u human being get tire simple know lot guy mix record lot time put gun studio hour get job do mix normally turn good guy planning mix record try cause happens human being top end disappear turn next day get back project wonder hell bright possible say stay away four clock five clock morning crap find within eight hour enough ten hour enough get little burn know easy tell say lot time gun record company put pressure get do get do record put tomorrow noon end say time mix turn well put situation like keep ear fresh drink lot water may walk away take break definitely monitor loudly lot people feel like turn crazy loud test speaker amplifier make little bit tire human being machine machine go day night human cannot time last hour session put record together make copy even studio redman dj premier six morning last hour fact like say put record together make copy back day told project come half inch quarter inch reel tape one studio one engineer use able master album four hour back day day case use also anywhere eight cut album day could cut forth album therefore album tend go eight hour forth definitely change game regard like say fact get tape come studio across land different producer make session go lot longer also raise hand urgently give example loud monitor play sound say like kind different set back studio three different type speaker nice genelecs sit console right couple foot big system back room nice small krk monitor nice people sit couch course session bounce around three certain people come gonna turn music accept like dj premier always turn way nothing eq play normal listen level soemthing music kid rock devil without cause wonder since get finish mix vocal loud enough request give another mix vocal louder eq little bit different thing master even able boost lot thing mids top end bass vocal somewhat real sticky area let say vocal level two db low cannot make two db level eq wise good engineer cover as speak master tape give vocal version normally one db would even smarter couple different one take little bit time lot less time print vocal one db vocal two db would go back redo time permit would definitely suggest like one vocal level go db two cover say early people go masterdisk master house try go cheap way technology afford easy way thing drawback people say music work use analog console old neumann analog console whole lot different equalizer compressor lot people day master record pro tool machine master menu do test remember engineer richard keller come dmx album master console first console go back master pro tool machine warmth get analog console get pro tool machine computer people day know tell think still something kind new guess whole pro tool master thing machine pretty incredible help close lot studio throughout land unfortunately ten grand buy machine mix console record everything unfortunately lot good studio new york well california probably everywhere closing machine master menu still feel way go level get like u achieve console know recently people call tell want open master suite use pro tool rig guy say guess engineer understand get sound good record like hmmm get big buck guess know laugh say spend lot money get record master right level difference know something year pro tool rig around long say matter choose whether record mix master think important spend time perfect craft go good overnight ego degree take time take time good say homework put time get level excellence matter choose think inevitably technology gonna improve give kind warmth pro tool technology surprised would something realize year technology stop consumer end well professional end always come something consumer end get money remember use vinyl cassette bought first cd player remember minidisc come digital compact cassette kind stuff consumer end always try something get money high definition cd everything else professional end pick mix magazine month month feel sorry studio owner always another pair speaker always another amplifier another mic something try sell make whole record process well think year come mean pro tool rig come long way first come thing first come choice choose machine choose sonic solution use hard disk edit system george lucas star war fame invent video use music kept technology pro tool rig surpass surprised year come software get well machine perhaps take master studio make feel personal level direct thread well like say stop technology know one day master record anymore problem go long kind get pay mean yes buy volkswagen buy mercedes car truth like person call ask well pro tool rig want master make record sound good difference definitely difference still prefer analog console go invest time master pro tool rig point least talk little bit fatigue ear fatigue anything keep ear specifically protect besides studio listen music lot spare time way miss think grow young man teenager think listen enjoy music lot living may turn radio hour drive work hour drive home listen music spare time much use miss sometimes know miss sometimes need little break guess one play music loud loud time play easy listen level think make big difference say listen music loud sometimes see crazy guy drive highway nod head jam crazy crank time definitely go concert club something tend stay away speaker definitely turn loud back damage ear speak say try listen critical ear far aesthetic go must time sit work something stand song stand artist get challenge try overcome try make sound good well think get professional get professional think get point two bring record master right bat like say listen lot offensive stuff although year old daughter sometimes deal rap stuff anything get little tire hearing bitch hoe as fuck shit nigger stuff time get little monotonous know country something call free speech get deal think regardless get professional year ago use heavy metal choice music go listen home relax get professional know always visual stereotype engineer white guy ponytail facial hair true stereotype experience fiction feel like broken boundary time work masterdisk come probably still get lot people come go like black mtv people surprised know website picture mtv talk music great album panel vote talk nine inch nail record alot people surprised two african american engineer feel make impact music business herb power guess normal black engineer master record hopefully year come change describe herb power importance know anybody buy dance record earlyguy name pretty much everything significant could talk little bit impact consider friend many year ago deliver package throughout different record studio new york ran control room master suite frankford wayne like wow kind inspire go forth felt like wow brother feasible possible first start masterdisk aspiration master remember see herb definitely bit inspiration go forth perhaps take advantage situation give see quite bit difference still business lot black mix record engineer use first start like say use ponytail grub face true anymore beautiful thing feel music heard people say may cliché music universal language really really feel way listen music go oh black thing white thing asian thing anything else music speaks u across board part country thing love much little different grow grow type relationship girlfriend record spoke could relate still record impact affect people like whether go something boyfriend girlfriend something life love music much always touch kinda reach soul say first hit record la bamba soundtrack actually compilation los lobos approach master compilation simply different studio also different artist different sound different genre maybe even well even backremember right long time ago come one source one studio yeah different artist track different approach cut cut feel large percentage create homogenous sound time respect individuality single artist correct like say think large portion already do actual record actual mix work already do say put ice cake want try keep consistent possible listen feel need do whether boost top bass whatever easy day like say get project cut do do ten different studio different producer try keep consistent possible across board easy probably lot easy say ever ambition record engineering produce sometimes wish get involve mix hung different studio watch record put together crazy crazy right word think crazy creative point mean combine track onto left right channel creative like say get two third already do put little glaze ice sometimes wish mix really cause think lot creative far produce stuff think start little old want venture stuff thought even mix sense would end home wife daughter know already work ten hour day try work weekend get involve mix sure would never home would end perhaps ruffle feather people work whole concept master experience mean sometimes hear issue classic album say master blah blah blah sometimes difference sometimes sound negligible experience well think technology come play think record day crazy crazy loud much louderdifferent type equipment available everything else think lot company issue remaster stuff perhaps do backsbring sync today sound like really like loudness people put record day think lot time destroys dynamic ness record played jazz record master never make record loud perhaps hip hop record lot hip hop guy want record sound louder next next next line lose bit dynamic ness music client want want lose play jazz stuff do recently find open dynamic please squash record make sound loud think mess stuff loses lot people feel way get caught client want make happy heard hip hop remasters record ten year ago like na illmatic supposedly remastered heard stuff ever compare say kind work listen music car home try best critical judgmental play either enjoy like vibe cause start start listen music go ooh sound good ooh need top end whatever home try best say bought issue stuff remastered say play something another example maybe one jazz piece something like give u another audio example talk ok would love play guy heard played jay z dynasty album played kid rock record mixed half inch ip love format ask prefer master want play something use new technology sure gentleman name somebody invent one inch machine music kelly price unknown sticky situation really think go certain person want master record cut vinyl explain say hopefully work give deal sometimes happens people cut vinyl broker somebody else wonder sound right talk lot half inch analog tape machine key sound really good align take care thing true cut piece vinyl high frequency alignment total alignment need do machine do right tell stuff go turn use every right ask use cut vinyl everything else important sure lot studio masterdisk new york lot studio offering break people day surprised like say call place explain situation list engineer master guy want every right spending money request engineer b c somebody want work pas somebody else accommodate client best care jay z guy start understand people start want go give type respect care would big budget people know think fair really thank much see new york welcome wonder could run difference master vinyl want bass one side get phase thing bass lot people realize difference explain thing oh yeah could lot problem necessarily change eq something cd versus vinyl find let say five track album want put vinyl let say fifth track lot top end high frequency stuff go cymbal fun stuff vinyl get problem inner band distortion exist cd cd make crazy loud type top end without problem inner band distortion yeah come vinyl deal problem like layman term would get towards centre record something lot top end could possibly distort high level get three track one closest label distort top end possible another thing people understand vinyl know lot guy dj good sound piece vinyl neighborhood ten maybe minute get vinl minute drop level happen play record minute versus one minute minute one probably sound lot well lot people understand ask physic longer record room take piece vinyl play old vinyl copy fear black planet sound really shitty yeah chance odd minute care cut piece vinyl way odd piece vinyl go sound good ten minute one work way issue try keep vinyl ten minute minute understand go sound good back day cd play use cut lot vinyl perhaps minute let people know go sound good piece vinyl nowadays combat master album minute long instead cut make two piece vinyl record company make four piece vinyl way piece vinyl minute long sound lot well minute long lot expense well would imagine yeah true cost four piece vinyl versus two everything sound quality important something consider another thing lot different thing sometimes engineer cut vinyl understand talk phase bass phase vinyl cut engineer real problem lot time happens machine cut groove phase go bass groove go deep thin deep thin gesticulates arm indicate thins much good chance record go skip possible maybe create two different mix make phase crazy cd stuff problem problem come vinyl get cut problem like say groove get thick thin thick thin sometimes get project happens go oh get cut vinyl something get deal get little trick get around stuff sometimes pj say someone give honest assessment say maybe bring master bring tape whatever much master process actually go back provide something else know dc lot guy part world go able come masterdisk call phone go pretty expensive call advice would give resource kind feedback well always try professional never come tell anybody mix piece shit think fair right day age people love compare record another record lot time record tends sound whole lot well want record sound like time fair say car create equal yes volkswagen mercedes car thing true mix sometimes master get wrong say make difference record perhaps get played radio one get take step process record mix master try get best engineer shortcut say know mix good fix master drive u crazy sometimes work way want amongst best sound record three step do well possible thing bring crappy sound mix leave master somehow turn best record world work like folklore profession say oh man come sound like perform miracle example thing like happen like say master make world difference get wrong really convince master make hit think call hit make make record write make record tracked studio make end record company whole team people get as promote record make happen heard mass really ask much term commercial success recognition much craftsmanship level within profession hear come sound like crap tony thing tight sort story like example top head say year sure case people record perhaps sound great come sound world well leaf master facility sure happens quite bit really lot really good master engineer give lot prop big bass brian call la really like way record sound work would know oh work kind stuff dr dre stuff whether eminem dre stuff cd changer car get enough album black eyed pea love record ask record would love record sound like would one love quite lot music listen would name herb power perhaps big bass brian know guy ever meet guy definitely give prop love way record sound stuff crisp yeah way like big bass tight nice open air sound think good engineer touch briefly rza people make intentionally grimy stuff know try objective hear thing genre music producer grime really want deal suppose sound grimy bad way sound grimy oppose good way sound grimy well feel strongly term master large percentage work do get people spend lot time record record spend lot time mix certain way go project want change ego kick go change record sound like accept fact record mixed record certain way reason try make little bit well possible like say sometimes people stuff like purpose mean dis kid rock earlier record perhaps really want sound way know sound good normally tend like record sound spoke engineer probably purpose question point yeah ten question try keep short two go say think like kid rock record maybe fact use lot live instrumentation way approach make record different way program mpc sp really say know do detroit engineer probably kill know people work record say thing whole thing good engineer get best equipment use say go engineer realm world say one important aspect good engineer listen back listen speaker lie way world go end good mix hearing really correct one phase game think important overlook decent speaker honest truthful listen environment correct almost impossible get good mix eq ing change really true may end sound good go car home wonder happen speaker situation listen environment important matter whether record mix master important would say would give truest sound mean know industry standard yamaha n speaker tannoy aaarrrggghh nscurse make sign cross well uk engineer tend mix nsstudio tannoy speaker well truth nspopular speaker damn near every studio stand speaker sorry room get confuse listen like hell listen key lot guy know get best speaker say little ago part craft good learn get best equipment engineer mix nsunderstand therefore come good mix guy really know nsreally put lot bass unless know well find guy turn bass lot come place like masterdisk like oh god much bass engineer familiar speaker turn hear knock nslike speaker every darn studio throughout country popular last question quickly talk pro tool master software thing problem mixed record cause work engineer right state keep run mix pro tool software master expect go master someone like planning go speak session problem master pro tool come master analog situation think mix engineer mix engineer leave master guy master record regular basis happens lot day say engineer bit pre master speak end find headroom get tape slam term loud crunchy sound compress make loud end headroom creative thing real problem lot day tell mix guy mix best let master go master guy people know problem people realize run pro tool master thing bring someone like problem one engineer work lot stuff ruff ryders little pre master give guy listen come say use sound file do let go ahead master thing knock anybody want go route like say get pro tool master compare let see six room place engineer tend use analog console something get pro tool digital realm say let mix guy mix guy tell master pro tool machine least ok thanks anybody else right ok want ask mix especially mix meant print vinyl safest low frequency use example kick drum cut hz hz low frequency get vinyl cut make skip without use phase mono bass well low frequency bass necessarily cause skip listen classical music one guy train classical music day record cannon shot kind stuff go way way low bass nothing wrong go tell cut hz hz anything creative fun know go vinyl want type low frequency bass phase end problem go low want yeah go low want creative fun often least u send cd print vinyl get back see sharp cut low frequency maybe get kind pop effect whatever get back vinyl get advice mean mix especially vinyl would advise mix engineer mix vinyl except bass phase advice really like say cut lot vinyl eq different vinyl cd explain earlier time may problem get inner band piece vinyl lot top end could inner band distortion bass wise phase sometimes run across instrument cause skip forth case master guy may cut little bit point speak everybody say limit creative fun type problem master guy let know ok another question get mix master know well get analog board get cd bit format preferable prefer get digital file like data cd file print bit resolution export mix environment whatever much range use dynamic range digital file much use give something slam peak level well crunch mix hit hard almost distort talk earlier give u lot headroom creative already slam pin meter master guy make loud plenty loud leave one two db tolerance maximum could even leave leave little bit like say master guy make crazy loud desire thing know day age know lot digital stuff use found digital world close feel like analog bit dat cd sound pretty darn amaze pretty impressed difference audio cd computer data file personally use converter play back converter use call dc guy masterdisk good sound whether get audio cd cd file play back converter really matter choice bit say bit may cost little bit u rent machine play back charge little extra worth sound wise feel anybody else say important produce music good speaker sound cheat listen back speaker set speaker would advise use low budget producer another thing get mix magazine every month hundred hundred speaker type budget personally small genelecs near console like lot tell model exactly five year come subwoofer amplifier thing incredible website sure small one also use krk monitor first generation seven series probably sell couple hundred unfortunately good product market different manufacturer tend want make well krk know go crazy year formica side make k rok triangle crazy stuff like first generation one call series think phenomenal speaker best way judge monitor play back material familiar get mix perhaps old record cd familiar always like way sound play back speaker best way test tell decent stuff familiar mix something familiar go tell need know favorite record love year say check speaker big system room use year hartley sub woofer altec middle customize tweeter top system old want something new afraid change simply make living know type speaker sound get well finally guy call francis manzelle come along speaker call griffin monitor old school ribbon tweeter big subwoofer incredible sound speaker unfortunate part cost much little car set room friday three day row come whole big bag cd stuff familiar record knew like master played music back three day played back give input like like end buying speaker get rid old one like say big thing use system use system probably year familiar comfortable want new speaker system make sure buying suit well played back nearly cd listen every one would skip certain cut would listen make sure want like like say speaker lie way expect mix do right way important use monitor sure keep mind tony go go studio break work stuff guy do opportunity ask question told u normal day ten hour hour want know hear ear tire tell know four clock morning enough want point come eq ing record like say really like start day personally clock clock start album session whatever could spend ten hour eq ing record problem eight ten hour sometimes little bit good day rest last hour day sequence record make copy even tend go three four clock session morning last hour sequence equalization anymore mean everybody different get learn limit definitely get situation mix wee hour morning simply check mix next day find perhaps darn bright ear like woah probably okay important certain amount sleep important get old use able alright five hour sleep fine function okay get old find need sleep little bit live perfect world sometimes way function right hour two sleep human being get ta remember machine think everybody room understands one last thing ever enforce kind rule make sure go beyond four morning ha ha ha yes turn time one year think work much knew cranky like cranky snap people everything else remember work record mixed timbaland two hour late session already equalize record make copy call request something kind snap good probably lose client work although do mix timbaland work since know start snap cranky people know overwork much tell people front office look work much remember one stretch work six morning three day row knew probably best tell front office look need day get away start lose snap timbaland knew lose cool cool lot time music business especially deadline always behind always do do time get get know body know function know push edge back get point year work late much unfortunately two four hour people would show late decide impose rule work past midnight fee go hour yes ridiculous amount money make money encourage people late know show time get job do people give shit know nothing charge rate keep go try combat case work people like oh go midnight like good good alright tony dawsey applause
