do computer move write flat london small kind basic bedroom type set move london soon write finally space actually gear remember exact thing get modular want look much fun yeah right huge learn curve start go london modular shop london well recommend try stuff james lecturer would see rig explain basically like synthesizer put together component separately link together wire component buy range oscillator traditional synthesis component right stuff exists available modular format gravitate towards first first stuff bought try build synthesizer use one computer vst synthesizer use lot point stop anaconda write native instrument massive wave table synth particular sound get cold almost like fm kind rubbery metallic kind sound module call braid similar type wave table synthesis however cool thing modular plug anything anything break control voltage like five twelve volt passing stuff one one thing absolutely crazy thing another module get confuse might see spaghetti wire come part charm really get sound experimentation fun natural least happen computer start buying stuff start sell stuff fin yeah module pretty expensive expensive hobby think one danger many option many manufacturer much like get something together like patch think oh one could make end go around circle bit end rig synth many many thing bit problem get confuse make choice take away thing produce sound sell oscillator concentrate thing control sound particular set module really kind blew mind chaotic module bit daunt actually try explain base chaos theory chaos similar randomness quite way visualize randomness like black white fuzz broken tv whereas chaotic noise like set initial condition turn something almost random thing repeat get modular environment start use chaotic signal modulate control melody velocity synthesizer get pretty wild stuff write black light spiral quickly write another release free download also usb box set like hour ten minute long stuff make three module thing told anyone mean module make music set set initial condition plug computer hit record sometimes go laugh record something hour would come back ten minute recording thought interest go play second track get quite lot melody chaos talk write melody find pretty wild concept understand music untold maze music skip kind hear like randomness certain phrase repeat chord hearing contact
