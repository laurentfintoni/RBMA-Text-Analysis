either hear low end frequency hear feel sound muddy system tune house use sub hz frequency trial error always completely different thing consistent tend play record producer know dubplates test system system deal know everything else okay would recommend make track low low low end bass equipment monitor difficult particularly technical scientific bass frequency use lot high mid range bass sound filter kind crazy wobble use basic sinewave sub usually sort fight go sub kick drum way deal sometimes win battle sometimes feel always lose get low end track rocket science ear preference certain technical thing good people told certain bass note tend translate lot resonance high frequency octave high tend build track bottom start sub like would house build foundation construct top cave really nothing technical recommend people like low end frequency difficult put music difficult make space around low end frequency keep sound flabby muddy drown frequency get nothing low end often sub high
