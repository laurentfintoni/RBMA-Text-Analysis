music institution world found th century rome five hundred year brings music people speak prefer play let hear little music let introduce friend colleague gregorio play applause yes please know instrument french horn tuba tuba yeah basso tuba tuba fascinate instrument want speak please gregorio play u music gregorio mazzarese live tuba performance gregorio played u great minuet johann sebastian bach baroque music music four hundred year ago let introduce beauty laura pianist pianist well play chopin music laura de mariassevich live piano performance great let introduce francesco play cello since arrogant want introduce play piece write name intrada music francesco storino live cello performance intrada oh ah ok need somebody help fiddle mic ok thank introduce different kind instrument guess many classical concert may quite new experience ok happy speak profound way first would like gregorio explain u brass instrument work interest ok tuba brass instrument probably know brass instrument somebody mistake instrument call french horn ok brass instrument french horn trombone trumpet trombone remember one probably see play way mimic trombone slide similar characteristic instrument make brass metal yellow metal call brass function instrument simple one tube instrument make sound part make sound one hold mouthpiece rest instrument tube amplificate sound form create mouthpiece similar characteristic brass instrument tube mouthpiece finger mechanism make tube longer shorter must see position finger mechanism forget ok see also trumpet see three mechanism ask ok sound tuba brass instrument make one like blow mouthpiece yes must imagine life make one brass instrument life make boo buzzing mouthpiece sound mouthpiece amplificated tuba way show similar electronic device sometimes device produce sound another device amplificate sound electronical master make computer device amplification one difference brass instrument electronic instrument also instrument see afternoon u acoustic instrument electronic device amplificate sound four finger know note produce lot report one note one finger lot note one position want explain push anything make one note lot note push one finger series note half tone low see first series play tuba one finger tube become longer longer make series note one note low low low mix one note one series mix another grade scale reason brass instrument trumpet trombone seven position mix one push two together note another characteristic tuba low bass instrument instrument make note bass register scale tuba one young brass section create last century trumpet find trumpet also medieval period instrument young technically difficult make tuba ancient instrument big sound need low register big sound brass instrument last century sound live electronic device sound orchestra sound music become big big big found electronical device permit big sound break eighteenth century music need power power begin reason born tuba also contrabass see contrabass friend storino explain francesco explain string contrabass become big need sound orchestra become large eighteenth century orchestra twenty string become thirty forty fifty begin twentieth century one hundred mahler writes symphony one thousand instrument audeince member usual orchestra two three tuba play ok always ninety percent piece orchestra found tuba one tuba piece especially berlioz especially strauss mahler mahler remember mahler two tuba strauss berlioz need two tuba stravinsky stravinsky stravinsky two tuba maybe wagner ah rite spring yes rite spring two tuba yes reason need create attention speak attention th century composer actually add lot low instrument work need lot instrument like double bass tuba maybe wagner schoenberg also two reason employ bass instrument bass brass also bass string need two situation first say need sound need sound need improve mostly bass also high ear men human people know easy heard central range difficult heard low also high range ear able distinguish good middle range go want employ sound need employ low probably know device find push way send immediately sound may call wider little trick employ bass high second reason make people afraid another trick example shoenberg zemlinsky use two tuba lot contrabass make situation afraid tension improve like tuba produce harmonic play tuba bass tuba produce harmonic wait bass player make afraid laura play piano low register poor need one tuba two tuba two double bass tuba produce harmonic high tone inside note yes theoretically play high want practically believe player work harmonic player play three ascend note tuba second third fourth harmonic first harmonic tuba one choose second harmonic elide high answer question cello go much high show ok last thing remember one piece particular brass instrument use make strange situation piece schoenberg call gurre lied gurre lied piece schoenberg want represent lot scene country gurre piece one point want represent skeleton end night go hearth use three tuba two contrabass posaune like inaudible go represent situation remember passage like one music gregorio mazzarese play brief tuba passage gurre lied skeleton go question laughter later tuba also use lot popular music like march band jazz band begin right one famous composer march band john philip sousa american yes compose tuba built tuba probably see tuba go around body player go way similar one shape change tube instead shape shape around body bringer player study kind tuba make easy transport play also aesthetic reason bell go go front two advantage first advantage sound play open air go go people orchestra second reason big bell write name band composer enjoy one long tube tuba meter without push tube popular tuba b flat tuba six meter longer push valve go eight meter longer thank ciao applause show secret string instrument course cello speak cello say string instrument first may interest italian italy string instrument invent name string instrument bow instrument strumenti ad arco bow instrument first explain name bow sound strange shape shape bow string instrument found th century original shape bow exactly bow like convex passing time need effect first spring bow effect like play cello see bow spring string found kind shape much well century shape change way speak bow may quite interest see know material one horse hair ok everybody know secret want explain think male female female male matter male male strong thicker characteristic matter think physiology problem horse tail course think horse inaudible yeah think substance end horse tail male horse female horse yeah example speak without problem think horse piss exactly male piss way point forward female piss way tail point problem female horse hair stink matter use male horse funny nobody know yeah funny laughter matter otherwise use kind horse white horse white horse instead black horse real physiological difference black horse give hair double bass bow thicker need thinner hair use white horse hair look string instrument see body main part instrument see inside body instrument empty inside two main part little cylinder wood connects upper bottom name italian anima mean soul position really soul sound depends correct position little wooden part sound good good english sound post italian soul ok poetic know one chain name chain wooden piece run upper part body way piece wood string instrument responsibility amplify sound make sound possible transmit body instrument release hole name f evident shape aesthetical matter push vibration string cello range string instrument like tenor human voice characteristic reach range human voice bass female voice go many note usually played violin height play cello large range note example show harmonic ask armonici armonici yeah harmonic ask mean speak harmonic principal note maybe one play cello theory come pythagoras okay important cut string two equal part sound octave upper show immediately put finger exact half string sound open string play cello finger middle octave upper divide three part octave fifth upper third string two octave divide string upper go sound harmonic see make high note push ok purpose demo push also soft talk francesco italian mhmmm see push point like make division push point play push lightly divide string four part three one like divide whole string four part see people see push sound becomes also high like divide eight part interest four push like push point eight part chord use make high sound possible harmonic meant harmonic inaudible tension note listen carefully heard ten second note able hear high note somebody hear yes soft inside first note lot harmonic fifth harmonic heard well harmonic chord ok yeah want play something want show cello example romantic music cello romantic music singer singer without word fact want play piece felix mendelssohn name lied ohne worte lie ohne worte song without word ok thank music francesco laura gregorio live performance lied ohne worte baroque period baroque barocco yes yes baroque period la baroque yes participant yes heard lot barocco life anyway baroque period remember orchestra double bass yet cello big solo instrument piece maybe explain well double bass meant exact double bass simply name double bass know double bass find one fascinate instrument exist quite new instrument shape kind technique depends strictly grandfather violone baroque music example string instrument modern string instrument evolution viola family renaissance period viola da gamba please let viola da gamba example yeah double bass quite viola di piede foot viola viola di piede old name double bass baroque renaissance period true bass instrument baroque music simply violone instead double bass exist bass instrument baroque music cello great solo instrument baroque period cello strange situation explain short time viola da gamba old parent cello noble instrument noble particular characteristic something like played court noble played king example consider noble found instrument like cello whose sound much powerful rich one gamba course great reaction cello consider en français le pauvre diable poor poor devil yes yes yes poor devil johann sebastian bach idea start change baroque music vivaldi write concert cello vivaldi cellist famous composer like tartini maybe like corelli great baroque composer handel telemann none write cello concerto none let say consider viola di gamba fantastic instrument fascinate instrument pity one sound soft beautiful importance cello start bach classical period beethoven example first important composer cello ok want change want speak tension want speak tension yeah ok heard lecture one interest heard tension idea acoustic play acoustic instrument usually use electronic device matter need make need make tension person help u instrument instrument sometimes also use electronic device inaudible thing make attention person attention make tension attention tension create tension music instrument want explain something ok ok yes speak play yes piece write francesco name piece orange arancione like color heart piece like shirt yes title piece think music think beautiful music point attention go point attention tension go many already heard start piece play speak piece another thing speak fine tune instrument speak afterward change tune example use mechanism top tuba bass probably see trumpet player move pump principle pump usually put pitch low high total instrument ok speaks italian music francesco laura gregorio live performance arancione heard start mood end inaudible make create various way attention example first make clear difference increase number player course first play alone tuba three obvious less obvious use dynamic use dynamic piece example start alone played quite soft soft example start play cello worry usual normal happens normal happens player happens even concert player concert look person switch concert funny return tension dynamic tension write piece start piece piano soft tuba start play write mezzo forte soft play play soft start softer tuba get please directly start play together ok ok yes ok start wrong entire bar number number second bar second number ten movement bad place ok look strong sound simply two instrument instead one play first second harmony richer begin give idea increase something play strong even piece three minute music play loud play end play loud cello break instrument play loud give tension dynamic use way expect another example may laura maybe let play place begin laura de mariassevich piano si speak italian music francesco laura live demonstration arancione ok thank hear happen suddenly dynamic real contrast real contrast yeah whole feel piano moment piano soft moment music like something happen like broken breath happen give attention even play way seem dis tension way ok clear explain yeah one way another example rhythmical example begin piece play go play play play play finally play example diminution rhythm every time faster faster faster faster faster movement faster beat faster write counting rhythm like way give rhythmical tension important faster write big impression music quite strange usually think faster music sound like tense music true example play pace two speed play like play play faster play maybe see difficulty play first idea clap beat second idea clap beat feel slow yeah feel slow music faster feel slow way make dis tension tension tension give play exactly tempo example good familiarity electronic device electronic device great advantage keep tempo use loop sure beat decide want change give personality play acoustic instrument risk play instrument like rush slow music use acoustic instrument use increase reboots give tension keep control rhythm absolutely make mind control happen rhythm feel little envy electronic device give something sure example rhythm envy stop think take control rhythm want give little example change little tempo maybe feel electronic device keep tempo felt little push tempo little faster start advantage advantage acoustical instrument electronic device ok resume go explain make tension music music also life also literature also life want make tension make afraid unexpected tension afraid something know know go happen go something know opposite tension boring boring know something repeat play bore music bore literature bore book bore life bore even repeat thing time people expect go perform go present go speak people intention give attention expect tension people probably useful work also electronic music also disco music happen two way one progression piece francesco two situation first way create tension progression mean go one direction sound laura play piano laura de mariassevich ok think use rhythm usual composition modern rhythm last one complicate could introduce another argument harmony variation mozart change mode major minor think know major minor know chord explain later laura de mariassevich yes explain later help francesco laura de mariassevich melody variation minor mode listen character intimate different variation minor mode expansion affect create intimate sad character want create sad intimate melody use minor mode efficient major variation play ok think different ok finish tell harmony matter laura introduces another matter brava applause see heard mozart change melody rhythm especially last like jazz rhythm mozart jazz mozart original mozart important last one must know music two century music two century perhaps three century th century last century th century base two rule major minor know one know music also music use electronic device base tune one mystery music difference major minor must know music played major mood francesco play cello note change one note half tune mean play change note hear music play feel mood happy sadness play major minor change one note half tone nobody know change note feel sad mood instead happy mood civility also make heard music tribal people country japan brazil cape town people inaudible happy mood sad mood nobody know two mood best music th century th th century th century last century begin th century something change discover either way mystery mood remain still today life music pitch move compose note nobody thing complicate tension want people make tension must play note note mean note change alto tone note make happy sad play happy sad put way note saw play know note trick another trick make tension use example harry mancini know harry mancini composer compose soundtrack yes charade pink panther pink panther yes remember begin pink panther breakfast tiffany especially pink panther remember pink panther begin inaudible yes play see make harry mancini three note need make tension need harry mancini know film know film story diamond keep music make tension first thing harry mancini put away modal note note make happy sad heard okay follow play know happy sad music modal node example happy play sad afraid know happy sad put away note know music know happy way make tension must know make music happy sad important also reason pink panther theme know minor theme already start cute wait one minute music know tension one minute know would major minor modal know lot composer classical music also soundtrack music use way make without first ludwig van beethoven th symphony th symphony beethoven start like play one minute two note b note tell u happen know play go go finally whole orchestra played music francesco storino performs section beethoven symphony know minor take two minute know three like happen know know know situation make scale scale inaudible position note decide music use today use inaudible position note bass note middle example play dominant second important something play example sensible note never stop note example see play stop play lead note subtonic yes lead note subtonic modal theory must understand last century put inaudible start another way music time explain inaudible really ask mic microphone microphone name alex talk tonality tone music concept mainly explore baroque period great work well tamper clamp establish opinion scientific essay tonality actually opinion gravitational force note modal music yes interest first absolutely agree opinion tonality gravitational system work even modality tension sense modality lay mode mode may consider son tonality father know sorry father concept mode earlier yes scientifically yes sure think th century inaudible example common opinion win theory tunnel theory four century absolutely mahler change imagine modal music great deal establish mode people could play middle age long discussion maybe interest may even little deep yes maybe little late time clock clock speak modal music happen last century three century modal music major minor like inaudible want find way present reality civilization go broke also music find new way represent scientific way make music decide mode scale situation dominant modal attraction note note understand import scientific academic decision must found different way way build music without rule regularly nothing decide table new rule one new rule decide serial music never heard serial music heard chuckle alex ok serial music music must make serial serial tone scale must play tone scale play another time one note understand mean must play tone scale laura play piano serial note choose set first one another another note play note two time complete set make another one make academic way make make set inverse really play opposite direction understand serial play one play opposite direction change interval make mirror like mirror academic way take mirror reverse take year last century become tell example serial music write tuba tuba understand play first note different play note upwards direction change tone happen music gregorio mazzarese live tuba demonstration opposite music gregorio mazzarese live tuba demonstration ok correct see music see first section second staff actually identical first read piece go go mean want find new way heard music probably hmm sound strange ear must understand begin sound strange like scandal scandal make music go situation find different way make music use sound nature probably way go electronic device improve electronic device use example cascade sound river sound martello hammer sound music use sound nature make music use way use train sound sometime mix use tape use instrument represent sound nature sound civilization maybe told much enough love end music yeah think play something chick corea believe matter difference classical music rather jazz rather kind music difference make contrast different inform u music different another great music great music leonard bernstein say two kind music good music bad music agree total learn much interest important history music go present also future music love kind experience common experience music chick corea hope something together sometimes really hope ok please would like improvise something u something yes want come music francesco laura gregorio live performance chick corea song thank everybody ask question answer alex ok think important thing ready handle new composition arrange go ahead multiple expert attention talk little bit little difficult element within composition composition flow stuff like feel certain structure formula particularly helpful many many thing depend answer depends example first personal feel important want put self yes music first okay ego way feel feel music want example happen arrange piece feel rhythmical even child song nice theme simple harmony feel great pulse rhythmic pulse inside make arrangement example group would write important rhythmical part drum body cello something like bodhran irish music example another important thing know absolutely perfectly instrument go use sound sound sound sound especially field technique instrument fundamental want sound want tuba sound example must know instrument think field know perfectly otherwise bring idea idea pas people play instrument play give idea big deal write piece afraid possible play exactly idea want push technique instrument actually cello way afraid possible play deal technical matter motion sit realizes chair anymore chair dangerous sit onto nothing afraid write something able play use people use two people play use two people play one another one get twp people put hand possible quite complicate explain obviously two people one instrument okay two people play part problem bend meaning technical meaning part play deal want like much write actually know able risk take another person risk make risk great risk music music cannot get scale fear enough play maybe play difficult music play example play octet go octet large play arrives moment hand small want write play hand could play ask two people play instrument coordination absolutely impossible hand know interest thing technically speak sorry cut late continue finish need wrap get quite tight schedule even thank much indeed ok thanks
