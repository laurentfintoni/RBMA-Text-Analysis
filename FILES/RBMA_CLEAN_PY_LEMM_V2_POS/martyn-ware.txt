might spark idea found guy call paul deveraux well know professor cambridge england style archeoacoustician go round ancient burial site temple pyramid etc analysis sound point view discover ireland series burial mound call cairn despite fact dot around country make different thing different size lining different resonate one particular frequency predominant resonant frequency hz mimic sound koyaanisqatsi kind thing interest enough suggest thing built enhance sound ritual burial combine take psychoactive drug interpret room carve inside etc notion idea ask one friend bunch student analyze fed different frequency see would happen brain mri scan guess exactly hz switch prefrontal cortex brain completely go trance obviously knew year ago particular frequency like free drug would put space trance therefore social trance everybody else space pretty wild think corollary friend mine oliver rothschild run various huge company around world particularly curzon group good man interested heal power sound know anybody do sound therapy lot view really accepted best practice actually establish currently go patent process establish sound medicine use different frequency see maybe heal different illness use different frequency imagine drug company feel way go thrill free way charge like charge need tone generator find stuff interest show lot stuff happen past forgotten discover time go lighter note friend brian duffy get thing call modify toy orchestra pick toy sorry yellow life normally yellow shit ok basically pick toy car boot sale p something examines gut get chip examines

place centre time square dundas square transmit information anywhere else world via internet except building internet work laugh anywhere else earth reproduce reproduce anywhere scale wild think could reproduce sound time square trafalgar square instance art gallery ulan bator kind blow mind translocation reality take away visual element bit like time travel something completely wild also talk people different interface obviously deal new three dimensional world new interface talk guy two year know remember minority report way move common move shit around well guy g speak actually design look go do real real move thing around screen go one actually go screen membrane reality virtual world broken actually create three dimensional world actually navigate screen use hand mouse nothing transmitter camera read spot special glove pretty wild stuff future like touch screen space three dimension wow work future hold well artistic educational installation theatrical stuff know imagine new form theatre musical theme park already talk disney dreamworks world premiere want make big splash people get bob know come u really work even well outdoors indoors importantly collaboration digital visual interactive technology everything get cheaper cheaper cheaper webcam software control shit get cheaper ultimately aim really like holodeck suppose star trek enterprise far away kind excite shut everybody question think definitely time put floor hi question guess maybe assume much approach synthesis emulative respect sort instrument know stevie wonder say totally different stevie wonder may notice think start point reason instrument evolve last thousand year western instrument world instrument reason normally base natural harmonic occurrence etc shape instrument hear certain sound require human intervention interested basic building block rather try make something sound like cor anglais interested shit fact interested walter carlos instance start get abstract know experimental stuff form start know switch bach thought pretty kind pointless emulate real instrument excite bit normal instrument analogue equivalent right word analogous equivalent actually stevie wonder quite interest example use band call tonto expand head band try find anybody know look limewire everything two guy kind academic participant youtube footage youtube yeah need footage need actual album put anybody know anyway guy go work stevie wonder instrumental stuff thousand time interest kind musically orientate stevie view participant monitoring sound want know position speaker mix many use really explain apologise software cope speaker location minimum need like cube really flatten cube need eight speaker minimum need four low give space four high go number want two ring tell software relation centre space x z coordinate go two meter right three meter two meter back every speaker press go kind creates convolves virtual space creates virtual space actually fly stuff live space know speaker great thing studio brixton london six meter diameter octagonal shape get two ring eight speaker create stuff mexico city installation completely different shape speaker put new speaker location automatically sent right amount signal every speaker also play live cool thing imagine sensor attach dancer instance ballet dancer interpret movement dance stage audience wild work royal ballet moment try get sensor small possible accurate possible quite difficult actually think would easy several lot lose line sight lose signal say instance one ballerina get hoist colleague attach sound sound move audience time pretty cool stuff like actually work size auditorium indoor honest mexico city piece first time do anything big talk talk actually go walk walk would sound good thought build right delay fade difference everything mind bendingly good go ask frequency cut know certain speaker air use full range speaker found use rather kind theory low frequency tend sound physically low space vice versa think historically cave men woman use ear lot survival purpose bird prey come screech could hear difference evolutionary advantage dude hear anything found instance synthetic sound quite high pitch swoop people back head front know give thrill use lot kind trick manipulate wrong word talk word positive manipulation wrong manipulate sound like mad scientist like try give people interest experience start make think something see curious know listen something level anxiety creates certain tone far study found certain frequency affect certain thing actually interested find frequency use interested normally result harmony incidental tone thing set teeth edge particular case even weirder say hz physiological effect coincidentally someone sent clip think american publication know anything thing zoo worker found machinery zoo compressor something give certain frequency analyze discover particular frequency drive crocodile mad drive elephant mad drive animal insane realize thing soon change fine hz blew mind people sent know stuff also another thing blew mind discover pulsar recently late pulsar discover resonate particular frequency well pretty wild know mean idea say like erich von däniken know shit go fully understand go research go along sonic heal foundation talk go look effect people negative side well like infrasound dude macho think like stuff use sound weapon stuff get quick question spatialisation stuff get past problem dopplereffekt get two speaker listen middle order think move across pan pitch go yes software doppler built want create completely realistic sound effect car come across know sound like found compositional purpose make everything sound terrible soon move everything towards thecentre change pitch whilst wish use certain application normally switch deal analogy physical world like invisible dancer move around room invisible speaker move stuff around room also like hey hear sound hear like wish fulfillment thing directional speaker sound shit try sound limited frequency basically anyone know different please tell point try create sense alternative sonic reality anything break illusion sound kind tinny work u question whether hardware use proprietary utilize people really quickly output individual different sound discreetly process live get enough soundcards enough processing master instead master stereo master however many speaker like thing lock like run thing live computer know know break leave installation run get one paris moment galeries lafayette big department store paris get another job break normally put onto hard disc recorder speaker correspond track master process obviously speaker processing power need reach cusp ran entire future sound tour refer laptop venue speaker run live interaction projection run machine even one late one point possible software sale use run something worth pound piece hardware run laptop cost dollar software essentially cost nothing though charge course commercial software cost pound educational know red bull academy probably give free one could definitely give free one get right thing lot stuff sponsor bower wilkins loudspeaker installation outdoor one pa level kind art gallery shop stuff sponsor bower wilkins loudspeaker could well interested donate kit red bull music academy actually return little credit question well first thank share insight million maybe two million tangent would love get would sit next three year might bit boring hate get back profane thing sentimental note hidden message kind skip whole let go bit could probably get send could share u bit bassline use nerd ok get tb anybody nobody anybody get software version well first come stand debate first official use one first certainly dance record mean literally write week come tb like drummachine much honest could program slide stuff like cool actually basic sound oscillator sound cool well give second keep talk rubbish favourite record ever honest actually programmed piece hardware sequence roland mc anyway know good get veneer side know everything number programme interface everything number mathematics debate day share play lot work vince clarke get every analogue synth earth actually pretty much even academic one buchla come later get everything ever control voltage gate attach hardware sequencer compare timing hardware sequence stuff like kraftwerk instance logic cubase oscilloscope timing discrepancy absolutely horrific unbelievable fact every beat would move bang millisecond late millisecond snap back next beat millisecond kind random within range think pretty much still like day everytime think use sample never ever ever unless come dedicate piece hardware via logic anything computer never sound accurate tight funky shit ever prove see work kraftwerk record sound like oh god hip hop dude love shit sound right money every beat indefinable shoddiness hope nobody logic get sue know dedicate piece kit let play let go favorite track ever miss start one track job music heaven let go applause another one crazy track backing vocal session thank much kind let play actually favorite inaudible martyn ware yeah yeah
