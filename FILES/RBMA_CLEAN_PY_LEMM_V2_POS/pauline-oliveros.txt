guy might heard call john cage often quote say know harmony deep listen pauline oliveros pleasure make music please welcome pauline oliveros thank thank like demographic statistic actually look nine year old statistically ever year picked accordion nine year old let see nine plus two help must yes imagine little pauline back sit room play accordion play hearing hearing hearing insect bird animal sound houston texas environment dense almost like rainforest overall sound interested like cicada much different kind thing heard fascinate listen far back remember sound source around human make radio oh radio course use enjoy grandfather tune crystal radio like sound tune radio much program father shortwave radio also enjoy sound shortwave turn well sound like mind explain crystal radio know include well device crystal know understand knew construction knew call crystal radio think find google pretty easy left texas go study california time already establish teach music university still quite new thing oh music taught conservative conservative kind music electronic music studio mostly center western european music first time actually lay hand tape machine san francisco state college well first record machine experience mother bought wire recorder record wire know work well work electromagnetism information store wire run around like magnetic tape wire instead tape magnetic tape next thing happen get tape recorder first time mother generous sent tape recorder sears roebuck one first consumer model tape machine available second world war veteran brought home tape machine germany california ampex tape machine ampex form produce tape machine mostly disseminate radio station happen soon get first tape recorder put microphone window apartment record notice sound tape heard tap shoulder anytime record make sure listen everything tell listen everything time trip laugh go california study san francisco people met continued work communicate many many year come first meet example terry riley terry class san francisco state college guess also loren rush probably well know terry wonderful composer met san francisco state college else part group la monte young vicinity back yes later happen terry loren actually form maybe one first free improvisation group terry write film score five minute time write go studio radio kpfa loren rush program assistant access ampex tape machine sat loren play koto percussion terry piano play french horn improvised several soundtrack five minute soundtrack without discuss go listen played spontaneously terry take one track use film decide listen playback maybe would fun start meeting several time play record discover try plan would fall flat played let conversation develop spontaneously would always get something interest get call sonics sonics group happen next terry loren go europe gotten ma guess mfa university california berkeley la monte young come picture class visit class met la monte terry la monte get together project happen la monte begin part community establish san francisco community group start san francisco tape music center least san francisco tape music center come another liaison ramon sender barayón met teacher mentor robert erickson robert erickson taught semester san francisco state first met first heard music heard mine loren rush already mention study begin study robert well bob robert erickson begin teach san francisco tape san francisco conservatory musicianship class attend met ramon ramon start improvise together terry lauren already go europe next step towards sonics sonics series concert put conservatory always include free improvisation begin would play tape piece make morton subotnick join u begin improvisation include mort idea form studio center experimental music speak meanwhile lucky enough win prize netherlands gaudeamus foundation chorus sound pattern mixed chorus go europe maybe six month come back morton ramon gotten non profit status san francisco tape music center join come back san francisco tape music center get form please see first picture ok see anthony martin anthony martin end bill mcguinness ramon mort look happy great time really fun option go back time think go back kind go go back time play early piece sound pattern time perspective time perspective first tape piece make listen bit speak sure music pauline oliveros time perspective applause minute everyone get curious include box set call tape electronic music hour tape electronic music box set include time perspective use piece use ok improvised sound use found object various kind voice filter use cardboard tube put microphone end tube hear voice modify acoustic tube different link cardboard tube use think use wooden apple box place small object sound either strike friction activate like metal strip vibrate box pick microphone lot cut splice tape thought labor intensive laugh would improvise long section piece put together continuity time mixer use patch bay put sound together make four channel version piece two stereo tape line play together four speaker conservatory hand get work tape hand yeah push pull yes fact home tape recorder see work conservatory work home tape recorder second tape recorder acquire silvertone tape recorder sears roebuck property function could hand wind tape record time could get variable speed record also two speed three three quarter seven half could record seven half drop three three quarter reverse record three three quarter raise seven half kind process available invent get involve invent building instrument well know one point help morton subotnick push piano stair would break could reassemble remember think think oh story mort invent must tell morton watch mort inventive laugh first time heard story come morton subotnick totally wall true beautiful know past colorful people mind day write know get involve building instrument start assemble machine sort would say instrument built interface design programmer program max msp first totally analog get interested distance record head tape machine playback head little distance meant delay ok monitor time record head playback head could could monitor possibility change amplitude say playback record head open would begin get kind reverberation fascinate hear work eventually start string tape one machine second machine signal put would pas two playback head two record head would erase already want possibility rout signal say second playback head back first back second could create kind interest rhythmic configuration pretty evident piece mine call bye bye butterfly listen ok answer question consider expand instrument system still use use last night concert instrument environment instrument play play back get back eis expand instrument system bit bye bye butterfly music pauline oliveros bye bye butterfly applause thank piece make san francisco tape music center absolutely yes become director return europe right do become director director point director move tape music center mill college director move tape music center mill college finance kind space get tape music center yes rent space divisadero street san francisco divisadero location think small concert hall could seat people built subscription audience tape music studio upstairs nice size room big equipment day miniature today mixer yet large telephone patch bay could passively mix sound let see think two big machine donate ampex tape music center various item pretty basic consider call classical electronic music studio built equipment never intend make music equipment test laboratory like sound heard bye bye butterfly make tube oscillator way make invent way make electronic music time set oscillator range hearing say around hertz would difference two three oscillator would use know tube oscillator look like big dial center face possibility set range go range hearing certain range hearing range hearing way could change pitch sound turn dial necessarily good way make music set oscillator range hearing learn accordion teacher taught listen difference tone difference tone difference two frequency produce difference also range hear low difference tone first heard difference tone sound corroborate way add tape delay system use bye bye butterfly way play oscillator barely turn dial reduce aspect oscillator play able sense want improvisational way listen come listen intently perform get sound get interested layer sound take tone microscopically vary get side band call simple setup actually could produce complex result another piece work difference tone iv yes university toronto montréal sorry toronto last week country though summer program number composer come learn electronic music university toronto one best classical electronic music studio time summer tape music center really ragtag studio put thing together best possible utms twelve lafayette oscillator tube oscillator one connect key keyboard necessarily interest able say put weight key could keep tone sound could play oscillator way bye bye butterfly iv also four channel piece do studio go want learn electronic music also study hugh le caine hugh le caine wonderful engineer make first electronic instrument play good summer piece come let listen bit iv music pauline oliveros iv applause thank thanks thanks lot thank mention hugh le caine work toronto instrument developer another instrument developer come san francisco tape music center work morton subotnick buchla interested work point interested synthesizer laugh certainly great respect pass away recently morton ramon advise happen try connection different engineer see could get modular synthesizer accord specification interested work collaboration produce buchla modular synthesizer demonstrate upstairs make bye bye butterfly thing like sound transistor work intently tube tube oscillator sound tube oscillator different sound transistor oscillator frequency response buchla synthesizer set oscillator example think cut maybe maybe remember exactly range time oscillator work little hard time transition work classic electronic music studio new modular synthesizer certainly san francisco tape music center move mill college morton subotnick teach mill steve reich way do master time steve reich involve maybe famous piece get ever make san francisco tape music center premiere c play piano right play terry riley piece course steve reich play yes play another popular piece time c still much played many place yes morton subotnick silver apple moon popular piece time also broader pop culture right yes lead pop musician rock musician time come san francisco tape music center want collaborate come collaborate u learn electronic music anthony martin picture visual artist begin rock show fillmore auditorium san francisco later new york fillmore rock band light show see today seed san francisco tape music center though study classical music environment people react san francisco tape music center group exactly interested people gradually thing change move tape center mill one thing important contract rockefeller foundation want u responsible fiscal agent mill u crazy artist laugh crazy artist still applause true maybe crazier know picked name san francisco tape music center ever debate call music debate term music course music laugh make piece toronto utms call music like gertrude stein piece phrase music loop played finally disintegrate piece want listen later piece actually extract performance tune meditation kitchen new york ok well right music pauline oliveros tune meditation live applause find specifically interest piece liken human body computer system text interview say give human code solve problem case give code right desire result make sound yeah algorithm actually give people algorithm become instrument yes right building instrument music make without human understand instrument always include human pauline oliveors yes human inventive creative thing happen able write yeah mention term expand instrument system earlier human piece heard already count expand instrument system technology well expand instrument system delay time require equipment yes early day expand instrument system lug around couple tape recorder heavy duty experience set do studio carry tape machine think couple sony triple recorder exactly lightweight would carry around heavy ampex machine big studio machine interest need truck load train load equipment thing first instance try make electronic music year come fact thing phone must remind mixer san francisco tape music center mixer mill either thing do variety way would figure say mixer san francisco tape music center people thing phone surprise fast thing go exactly imagine future imagine would happen like predictive say eis expand instrument system always delay pauline oliveors yes specifically delay fascinates accordion player play sound little possibility bend play sound delayed sound return could bend foot pedal would send would voltage control delayed sound get quite pedal er control pitch foot come back delay important bend original sound could certainly bend second sound third fourth whatever reverb played important role though work especially think one day actually hometown cologne latedeep cistern played right yes second reverb delay underground cathedral water supply cologne yes whole project forget name person instigate cologne something else invite cistern also close time stuart dempster panaiotis go cistern fort ward washington state climbed foot ladder cistern pillar make reinforce concrete second reverb time make cd call deep listen go listen bit pauline oliveros stuart dempster panaiotis music pauline oliveors stuart dempster panaiotis lear applause thank thank release think yes release new albion record make record go cistern call deep listen namesake practice practice developed many year actually together partner sit ione yes ione maybe like introduce practice u yes well first want say decide release name album come deep listen laugh lot roll floor foot underground deep listen come pun pun good know lead agree happen start name different program deep listen first deep listen retreat sangre de cristo mountain new mexico small retreat center thing happen besides generator electricity electricity generation water rain rain water peaceful wonderful place start practice say go deep listen retreat know next would say eight year learn lead facilitate rather like facilitation leadership hierarchical facilitation collaborative people ione sit right practice listen dream part deep listen facilitates call dream community people start dream together often experience dream relational creates kind interest community analyze dream creativity come happens dream part deep listen practice part heloise gold heloise movement practitioner tai chi creative movement part also listen body important practice recently experience want tell illuminates deep listen well whole year work tarek atoui improviser composer commission instrument built hard hearing deaf teach rensselaer polytechnic institute tarek residence artist experimental medium perform art center need interact student seminar call new instrumentation performance student eight work project build instrument interface hard hearing deaf interest project take bit thought experiment end semester concert student project another concert may instrument tarek commission next time work together bergen norway last august past august first time get work project actually deaf people three first day residency interviewed robert demeter facebook demeter robert robert demeter anyways robert beautiful interest vibrant communicate translator halfway decide decision would make would ask robert conduct piece call sensational sound hearing non hearing performer arrive bergen title decision ask robert conduct piece first kind compositional decision right two woman deaf also talk musician go use piece norwegian philharmonic dozen musician ask three deaf performer teach musician perceive instrument play told musician leave instrument home another compositional decision instrument perform instrument tarek commission beautiful see engage right away non hearing hearing performer relationship turn around deaf something teach hearing end even two hour time musician improvise instrument sound pretty good next day give first section piece ione contribute take dream process creative aspect dream preside first section piece call eagle nest dream name one performer performer kind interest dream name fit section eagle nest in out robert task conductor bring people take simplistic thing happen start improvisation quite obvious robert kind amplification device perceive music ok clear conduct give musician expressiveness expressiveness come understand gesture feel sense level probably whole body music extraordinarily important way robert conduct whole piece minute audience sell people venue former sentralbadet municipal swim pool instrument set deep end pool appropriate right without water without water right could imagine water want good moment open question pauline actually want talk experience radical quietness question sure microphone somewhere otherwise able hear hard hearing hard listen long microphone go around good hi want thank inspire performance last night lecture meditation question session right whatever like say ask sing like comment dance whatever lot question throw one first related meditation session realize use lot power silence music also way form concept last night realize rhythm actually lie silence pad play found interest also realize use lot intentional sound address like sound make purpose emphasize sound make purpose want ask perceive role silence creative pattern like know thought practice call deep listen time always listen around well mind perform generate first sound happens listen listen maybe listen exclusively maybe listen everything hear something incorporate perform example interest time vancouver canada play really beautiful wooden structure play solo accordion v accordion accordion one life somewhere probably minute performance fire engine go performance one three people come say get fire engine go time answer listen heard become part piece call pauline orchestration laugh another question besides use silence developed analog use technology like talk maxmsp last night use midi laptop together instrument want know take role technology make music prefer one another like perceive say somebody programmed think self still like concept still analog like use technology help make way want perceive use word technology mean computer right yeah like development okay analog native heard awhile back start transition expand instrumentation maxmsp analog become computerize eis system almost completely maxmsp program however always analog end get signal speaker speaker analog would replace speaker future sure would materialize sound computer pretty interest project somebody somebody try would nice could materialize person one place another fly plane ok right answer question yeah definitely hello hi thanks much everything follow question hybridization extend instrument system sound really fascinate like maybe know detail improvise strictly maxmsp program interact yes well course do data design way programmer help make possible course always ask impossible thing keep develop evolution system since would say ask ask specifically wonder perform interact system totally clear work speak totally clear either laugh necessarily want interested listen come back interact perform told expand instrument system algorithmic change play sound know necessarily go happen may come back modify change pitch change modulation kind act sound bend various way whatever play expand mean extend expand play present listen sound come back future listen back past expansion time consider time machine every sound come speaker sound make point performance sound process algorithmically system expand instrument system beautiful clear explanation way thank something open source share wider community exclusively something use maxmsp right open source code maxmsp know max want work within program would work max right possible though perfect thank follow question regard say hybridization system consider technology part way consider kind cyborg make music cyborg huh yes course cyborg replacement lens eye example couple teeth mean way say play technology part yes feel feel intimately connect happen yes mention facebook presence someone work earlier deep listen happen social medium lot find kind surprising would feel contradictory deep listen practice spread noisy environment well mean listen listen world wide web listen noise listen noise yeah somebody else ok hi hello thank much lecture question guess aware thing call schumann resonance idea like tone tone proportional earth like bass tone earth produce kind musical think build world vibration music exists exactly relation proportion earth human body think may frequency suitable geometric proportion surround frequency time low get high get like telecommunication stuff also new meditation start oscillate meditation go high think suitable range frequency human body get kind special information music think would could learn quite bit hang deaf community hearing ear mean hearing really whole body obvious interest robert conduct piece conduct gesture appropriate instigate different rhythmic pattern well perceive go also queue people musical way deep listen deaf community inform always like around deaf community even though learn sign still feel something important go term expressivity presence interchange one another think find really interest information good advice thanks welcome well ok ask anyway first hanna mention something facebook something instructionary instruction really fit facilitator whatever deep listen technique something one could follow idea dream community thing talk yeah well yes sure example kathy kennedy life montréal kathy say go come online online yes anyway kathy kennedy call deep listen certificate entitles teach deep listen workshop person could communication find online kathy kennedy interest video youtube watch pauline teach go deeplistening org believe yeah see think question matias yeah want let ione speak first ione add deep listen program teach happen online happen center deep listen rensselaer people actually study certificate deep listen totally online program special innovative wonderful yes sure thank much information add another question go little bit back ask maybe formulate another way listen insightful lecture lot fascination instance radio sound shortwave much understand like real reverbs like physical approach also thing would say physicality way imprint tape something find analog mechanical physical way wonder oppose physical approach create explore sound nowadays somehow facilitate obviously digital technique simulates simulated delay simulated somehow thing provoke create via tape technique happen simulated way seem really happen see physical process sure different simulation see also change quality environment follow obviously nobody u many u access either system swim pool studio full tube oscillator obviously place allow u experience therefore one go accessibility program available everyone want listen reflection yes course well yes pretty much different think example commercial instrument available may short change term frequency response simulation may take short cut simulation resemble completely analog version get well think thing get well term term technology computer programmer listen taught probably engineer deep listen class rensselaer polytechnic institute think quite change participate learn actually improvise compose perform end semester student produce two recording mixed edit make piece maybe three minute piece like never experience respect really come listen listen work tool adequate express want express important think choose carefully think choice enormous actually especially cruise around internet talk people world think absolutely fabulous also want comment impressed red bull music academy create special place work interact one another interaction probably important interaction terry riley loren rush stewart dempster lifelong friend still touch thing sometimes stewart deep listen band year people meet go variety way go along interaction say blessing important thank much question left left yeah hi want ask deep listen meditation encourage inclusive listen inside outside happen far place different dimension think possible express transition make music somehow reduces listen melodic line certain constraint within listen inclusive listen experienced meditation way reconcile think possible express feel deep listen inclusive listen music sound strive music particularly enjoy listen something attempt ok sit perform listen listen everything try open whole field whatever involve time people come want know could get fire engine go time ok studio work analog come work analog studio important part listen studio instrument adapt intention purpose purpose intention come listen always primary say get get make plan follow say improvisation follow plan always fail quite well plan anything go listen answer know answer want yeah addition personally practice found gesture immediate response listen practice rather sound next phase first gesture sound come afterwards mm hmm find lot work body movement important part yeah important listen though body sort formalistic practice like tai chi chi gung yoga example good practice keep go also creative movement important move freely find thing body spontaneity spontaneity movement think really important part practice yeah thank hello thank much lecture concert yesterday work thank maybe question obvious would like hear thought important deep listen yeah important well might important know start pun right pun important happen course produce least maybe deep listen certificate holder call go program qualify teach workshop produce quite online course deep listen certification run tomie hahn director center deep listen rensselaer program open available new one start january one year course meet sunday be eastern time month instructor first time instructor go deep listen certificate holder come along u ione heloise visit class give input twice whatever begin send certificate holder carry many workshop different part world carry deep listen forward lot inquiry lot recognition seem help way hope lot way thanks everything wonderful lecture question relates engineering spoke earlier taught engineer programmer help system use perform also career decade know eet lab collaboration also engineer wonder right many tool available produce mainly engineer quite integral new practice artistic practice would describe interaction engineer prescriptive know exactly want collaborative idea interaction expand system performance come understand criterion objective engineer ok deep listen class everybody participates first call energy exercise energy exercise go whole body activate lymph flow blood flow electrical flow begin understand nerve ending palm hand actually feel electrical impulse feel begin thing also nerve ending sol foot sense call three different energy heat feel heat foot foot might cold expression get cold foot something feel pull gravity feel else forgot heat electricity nerve ending sol foot energy exercise help people recognize different kind signal body happens weekly practice come exercise engineer begin use exercise recommend people sit front computer day get call arm swing swing arm forward back release tension arm lot u aware much tension hold arm part teach one aspect next listen meditation like do different focus give listen meditation listen meditation period journaling student write experience exercise break break mean four hour seminar take care first two hour second two hour always kind workshop instance ask people bring found object class make sound find something make kind sound heard across room bring found object listen person object get small group say four five people work together minute everybody demonstrate improvisation found sound next project probably record found sound make piece keep go like finally end semester produce two recording piece do improvisation do composition compose found object record piece get lot experience listen different way ok work engineer listen assignment every week read book call audio culture lot really good information different composer practitioner various kind nice discography bibliography student ask listen three piece write three sentence piece three sentence review end semester student write final paper base journal base thing listen whatever choose subject engineer often ask well listen noise piece lot fun say guy go machine shop make record say sound new york city know compose say guy guy engineer one risen noise level new york city place high say deep listen thank hello hi thank question spirituality spirituality oh ok always part intuition inclination towards spiritual path also musician deeper get make music try understand relationship music spirituality become little clear start lot drone orient music tonal listen lot long tone lot slow change filter thing like wonder experience like practice get music form spiritual path relationship music important listen spiritual path listen learn able put someone else position part spirituality applause thank would like say pleasure listen listen pauline oliveros thank much come thank applause
