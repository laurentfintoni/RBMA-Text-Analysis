basically let explain little bit machine little bit history left side see actual synthesizer modular synthesizer synthesizer plan distribute magazine call formant german magazine modular synthesizer electronic music big thing midbeards synthesizer kind stuff basically thing could subscribe magazine subscriber would get detailed plan front panel solder module modular synthesizer make different module different thing case old enough time found vienna actually twice big do really badly previous owner must really young eager something time bought sit studio year year really work rarely use point decide give try make small select module really work take whole thing apart whole thing clean print solder whole thing together still rough piece comparable moog modular system arp rough special modular synthesizer like make little bit special everything see right side relatively new still built today top analog sequencer step sequencer might know doepfer sequencer also sequencer also software also emulation step sequencer one built guy germany call sebastian niessen munich use equipment kraftwerk well sequencer couple year think kind stop basically still around available filter bank basically control extra output synthesizer custom make fit configuration basically input output mixer sum signal output stylish vu meter actually really nice sometimes play really know come look thing know come actually kind useful back synthesizer case point left side module four vcos vco voltage control oscillator question point say vco vco oscillator basically make waveform order heard different waveform select like square wave sine wave sawtooth four oscillator two filter come second configuration synthesizer split middle output side synthesizer point left side synth module output side synthesizer point right side synth module also two vu meter let start really easy vco basically vco generates wave press trigger fire one oscillator demonstrates sound demonstrate trigger waveform part demonstrates sound press envelope follower change waveform say select various waveform mix course example sine wave demonstrates sound get square wave example contrary demonstrates sound various kind sawtooth demonstrates sound alone make tone tune adjust certain thing bandwidth square wave demonstrates sound basically vco little advanced pretty simple pretty simple one course mix different waveform let say want really deep nice bass want certain crunch demonstrates sound mix two waveform clear question oscillator think oscillator one waveform seem switch like five time oscillator generate one waveform time case possibility actually bit easy make sound want four oscillator produce simultaneously five different waveform time sound mean waveform time yes course knob mix switch switch say actually four oscillator select waveform cannot really mix together mix amount four oscillator cannot mix amount waveform one oscillator quite cheap solution actually well one waveform per oscillator ok basically four see envelope point top left side synth module mean trigger demonstrates sound oscillator create certain way sound go attack decay sustain release mean attack mean long take sound actually come first moment trigger long take oscillator play put like demonstrates sound little plop decay mean long sound sustain mean long hold reach high position release mean long go away knob demonstrates sound four control basically shape way sound come put long release long attack demonstrates sound inaudible question case one envelope oscillator go envelope little bit advanced system envelope envelope explain mean sound shape show attack demonstrates sound decay amount time sound take reach high amplitude demonstrates sound sustain mean long stay release mean long sound push button basically work part part second envelope work filter brings u subject filter think go sequencer run inaudible question yes machine like lot old analog synthesizer control control voltage cv gate control voltage mean time midi everybody remembers time midi even time midi way put keyboard tell oscillator play press key found apply little voltage think like volt different machine different kind system well press key send little signal synthesizer tell actually sound play high play cv gate system cv tell high play give value like zero volt trigger say event take place two cable cv green one gate sequencer output tell tone play trigger output tell tone play start move along start sequence oscillator heard twiddle filter button basically finger knob point envelope follower button sequencer three row sequencer first row give pitch note _adjusts knob _ sorry little problem sequencer little rush today morning really prepare restarts sequence ok fix good basically trigger note see adjust envelope like make short sound make long sound oscillator side accompany second oscillator mix two together change sequencer sound basically like two voice play together side find nice way sound together point left side synthesizer waveform sent filter electronic music probably important thing important invention probably filter make actually sound interest make sound cool modulate probably go turn knob frequency go turn knob lot filter happen side turn filter knob certain type filter low pas filter mean everything low pas everything high cut away mean move along demonstrates filter knob check much amount want high frequency much low band pas filter give ability cut everything away high pas filter basically high frequency basically three part course also mix demonstrates filter apply modulation thing mean see lfo also oscillator like four oscillator hear oscillator meant heard audible modulation tool show display lfo actually frequency somebody see something point screen little red light actually frequency oscillator produce couple different waveform case switch meant heard modulation various thing easy way demonstrate put filter knob assign cable lfo run modulate filter lfo demonstrates see frequency modulate filter also thing oscillator affect frequency oscillator demonstrates together demonstrates one frequency stay modulate demonstrates actually do different input take lfo put filter take lfo put oscillator manipulate without basically know oscillator kind know filter envelope shape sound play different kind modulation example different kind lfos also modulation like ring modulator mean basically take oscillator mix two oscillator together feed back filter actually demonstrates sorry sequence sound know extremely annoy thing could come moment twiddle knob demonstrates ring modulation hear mixed two frequency together put ring modulation mean frequency also go affect frequency another modulation possibility sound could get two different frequency go example get two different note go put ring modulation alter keep difference sound alter understood right thing take two frequency whatever also frequency audio signal side mix together grab ring modulator another external input put example beat voice whatever mix together waveform pretty much mix say drum two thing might sound like come different place put make sound like much like mixer mix thing together like modulation frequency oscillator affect way audio signal sound mix frequency together maybe show white noise take frequency twiddle knob demonstrates hear noise together frequency oscillator random noise twiddle knob demonstrates take another frequency sound totally different ok let explain sequencer really quick point right side two main module basically sequencer step sequencer mean event event one bar let put way first easy situation moment actually time scale synchronize sequencer drum machine basically press play drum machine idea actually go one bar count one two three four one two three four start first step sequencer one easy way could play simple step sequence twiddle knob demonstrates see every step note put middle light simply play note ok simple moment trigger oscillator length tone do say ok nice one want kind melody put step button sequencer start look note point top row sequencer basically work keyboard say one note next twiddle knob demonstrates next twiddle knob demonstrates basically play keyboard really fast machine cancel couple note make little funkier part point second row sequencer stop sound turn knob one two three four five six basically one octave turn knob one time around go c next c row transpose option point rocker switch mean transpose every single note note play moment use full octave point top row sequencer use octave octave already three octave hand probably would use thing like let restarts sequence want transposition also decide high go go six note go full octave transpose full octave note actually thing work course basically play three octave one row point top row sequencer pitch actually make overall pitch adjustment transpose whole line demonstrates everything work follow put use second line sequencer basically line free assignable basically follow path little different one top row sequencer go note note note one second top row sequencer free middle section go example show filter also line second question meantime sequencer first thing put note yeah question get connect drum machine thing midi clock midi midi basically drum machine start sequencer master clock midi clock drum machine sends clock signal whenever start machine sequencer run time basically feature every machine inaudible question sequencer basically midi well master midi also slave another thing normally work computer studio drum machine would slave sequencer much easy change tempo drum machine stuff like change tempo sequencer see work away little knob really cool sequencer follow master clock studio obviously thing midi channel like assign example first channel trigger trigger press play right explain use old school way cv gate mean gate tell exactly event happen cv actually tell happen kind note oscillator play basically two control also possible control midi keyboard sequencer little difficult midi show actually happen cv gate much graphic show module work example want control something second row sequencer possibility control filter within groove track follow kind step top row sequencer take control voltage sequencer remember put lfo earlier filter sound like demonstrates basically filter little red light opening closing filter time nice thing sometimes get kind polyrhythmic feel thing want time rhythm actually well use second row sequencer like demonstrates side closing filter side opening turn first knob second row sequencer like basically work every step step sequencer could could close everything hear filter really close like would turn hand could go switch everything highlight couple sound come part want come little button top like one middle three step well middle stop put way break everything else good question ok maybe told little earlier go restarts sequence see push little button rocker switch top row sequencer sound go point put middle stop play sound another position mention reset position put lot different thing like play like six step basically tell sequence end always stay within loop understood ok go back filter part actually use line second row sequencer control filter let put second voice sound nice basically hear left side first two vcos synthesizer also go put right side vco demonstrates stop sequence want control one thing kind controller like second row sequencer use part basically mixer various thing like control voltage trigger use kind thing give possibility actually take one controller put mixer use take use different filter use actually filter also use filter simultaneously demonstrates one high pas one low pas actually use kind pattern control two side band filter turn voltage control filter demonstrates interest thing start mix source modulation like would line always modulate style go go take one free run lfo link sequencer free run go mix synchronize filter movement unsynchronized movement get sense always repeat pattern get kind random filter effect time always stay within beat see hear modulation still hear modulation come sequencer stop sequence question modulation get something filter envelope single note put general envelope filter like way filter come like say quite simple rough piece plug in nowadays filter envelope every single note little bit question time machine actually built could part point third row sequencer could put modulation every single step mean want one note point fourth step step sequencer mixer input modulate put modulation go modulate one thing nice way work around flaw machine general really basic one envelope say could put like filter attack note would played like show second restarts sequence highlight filter movement certain note sequence try find way really good hear ok get envelope sound demonstrates usually able set bit beast laugh maybe broke plane idea work moment usually able set filter envelope control adsr switch one envelope whole side synth ok thank cool listen note sequence go case also set sequencer variable speed mean push th clock go eight point third row sequencer adjust length trigger wait end get really weird sequence triplet five seven yeah spend enough time select reset cellphone interrupt really subtle change groove want make sequence work lot little fiddle note length basically time make fit kind groove little bit fiddle around wait till end way right point middle third row sequencer wait next one basically get rid sequencer feel actually program basslines use filter movement audio material something like interest thing everything point left side synthesizer say vc voltage control example voltage control oscillator mean low frequency oscillator meant use modulation filter stuff like also voltage control lfo speed give interest possibility use lfo mess time sequencer run midi note also go ahead let transfer trigger send synthesizer mess around timing use modulation timing modulate oscillator filter timing need little set get gate point sequence module go use one gate base trigger would control sequencer gate synthesizer take put basically happens connects cable within sequencer module restarts sequence thing use one would use one voltage control lfo square wave would play alters sequence actually still play note right time play trigger right time find interest mixture right time wrong time always stay time time correspond random time put random time random trigger get demonstrates back random actually use second row sequencer filter movement control filter frequency also use row control speed lfo manipulate time basically close circle manipulate time various note let get cable really quick output second row sequencer take put control voltage lfo see open control trigger change order note turn knob get slow get faster see somehow know really hard see back mess around timing actually general every note let see sound restarts sequence normal timing put timing change speed lfo accord note nice easy way get away kind really static sequencer aesthetic normally good thing work machine example open one computer upstairs moog modular v instal software version moog modular system also come analog sequencer basically thing point sequence module modulate time modulate filter oscillator also virtual model feature specific machine do well check think instal computer also try mainly advantage actually cable select modulation part actually see sound go abstract number something something type something happens want learn synthesis general like synthesizer built part actually modular synthesizer bad way start visual actually see go course everyone go buy doepfer would recently available synthesizer simulation like moog arp modular synthesizer plug computer really really nice platform learn maybe see want go one day maybe buy modular synthesizer begin look little complicate think really nice way learn synthesis general tell little bit thing bottom cv mixer basically really simple like kind mixer sum mixer audio mixer point second row cv mixer put kind signal want put audio signal distribute point top row cv mixer case one control go middle row sequencer lot thing could control could control two filter could control frequency modulation oscillator find way splice cable couple copy also mix together like example use filter take two modulation signal one come sequencer one come free run lfo mix together would like one filter would need kind mixer cannot splice cable cannot put two different control one jack way distribute signal within machine right side cv mixer little bit different story basically four different audio input meant audio distribute left side synthesizer distribute right side synthesizer go four different audio signal go ok one go left one go right go go go synthesizer come envelope follower process external audio signal actually synthesizer really nice play machine live travel around never sure whether broken treat really bad plane course play example band take microphone put drum put ability filter drum put like bass play band always really hard timing tune improvise sequencer general laptop always really hard get integrate session tap away work found way actually convert incoming audio signal trigger signal way use drummer play get trigger signal play beat sequencer run automatically beat drummer never worry time play crazy stuff sequencer go wild well kind nice know basically play within session musician without worry keep tempo nothing bad session everyone play click machine run click little chaotic also nice simple way play alongside musician unexpected situation dry send wet send switch well yes also decide one side follow sequencer follow drummer work bass anything whatever generate trigger side use filter filter trumpet vocal something like four sends yes four signal without add synthetic tone signal yes basically turn oscillator like thing hear signal come filter get external trigger go sequencer play strange select way drummer play make thing apply let say filter trumpet go filter basically beat filter modulate hand within band make really nice actually interaction always try set way modulation sequence go could explain make long short note individually instead use envelope tie note thing cv gate way midi machine question program use third row sequencer make individual long short note problem cv gate give trigger play control cv gate two cable individual length note could could modulate vca amplifier end whole thing could make simulation long short note within configuration cv gate way could make staccato legato note configuration midi midi control make note long note short cv gate would need third row sequencer control length individual note play keyboard course play keyboard decide whether stay long short whole set envelope individually would need third control would need cv gate control length every individual note mean work way around part actual configuration tell trigger sequencer drum example drummer hit snare trigger start play right set different mode say hit drum start play make much sense start play play speed could whenever something hit whenever trigger come play speed next one come start kind match shorten sequence enough play one two note yes like effect thing like slapback something want sequencer follow beat whenever signal trigger come play one note trigger come step along time line show really quick second latency trigger come necessarily come external sound let take drum machine output drum machine basic beat heard restarts sequence see distribute audio signal drum machine via cv mixer left side actually hear right see mix see trigger generate point envelope follower signal come time example take get information drum machine drum machine still run ok trigger work know would usual case smirk basically know point left side synthesizer basically know sequencer work filter bank side basically ten band filter nothing mysterious spectacular question machine dial middle left side synthesizer tell u call give u demonstration ok let get go restarts sequence oscillator side waveform output mean loud module tune demonstrates go way way fine tune actually tune track instrument whatever demonstrates fine tune every oscillator important go tune really easy whenever really good thing fit music grab record take somehow twiddle around recall nothing go go magic moment tune oscillator actually start work kind important later want play bass play guitar tune actually normal guitar tuner tune every oscillator c whatever go restarts sequence vco fm mean frequency modulation modulation input grab example free run lfo turn modulate frequency oscillator note play also frequency modulation really depends waveform square wave switch demonstrates course could also use modulation available right side lfo bandwidth square wave basically regulates wideness square wave every analog machine thing bandwidth modulation basically thing enables modulate manually ok basically work vco way filter work way go filter frequency envelope voltage control filter decide much filter actually go filter envelope really look like filter envelope take beating plane q factor self resonance filter warm filter without resonance modulation way modulate frequency oscillator basically modulate frequency filter vcf external sound input mean come source externally put directly filter without go device take example white noise add white noise filter least thought obviously take beating stop sequence could go external sound source directly filter let run work module top row left side envelope output say vca voltage control amplifier basically tell loud overall sound side amplify also control voltage control envelope follower generates trigger want lfo ring modulation phase shifter really weak machine normally like phaser modulation sample hold noise generator lot explain specifically really hard keep kind general machine studio available everybody play along afraid cable nothing wrong cannot break take put bad thing happens nothing go happen try freak around ask question quite big field quite unlimited possibility inaudible question go set small dj mixer headphone output whenever people work studio synthesizer need sit headphone could come powerbook get record generate noise frequency record onto computer want use think try make understand public way know sometimes quite hard follow hand try see much self explain phase shifter work expect question basically another modulation go signal double signal kind put phase make nice flanging effect try one really weak one system really good one like moog phase shifter example sound really really nice one particularly really good one honest put otherwise would hole use voice microphone signal external modulation yes basically line input point cv mixer work line signal want use voice instrument like guitar control sound also envelope follower give trigger give trigger envelope basically trigger signal envelope control stuff patch certain way control filter stuff actually external audio also mean voice ok thank tell way signal take module basically modular synthesizer basic structure inside mean even cable front way would oscillator go filter oscillator control envelope course audio signal go filter go amplifier end basically signal filter put basic structure see cable front module start sequence sequence run actually work without cable put let say whenever put something modulate certain part put basically cv gate cable attach play exhaust applause thank
