audience perfect example wonder feel kind parallel even repurposed something different audience use equipment studio equipment instrumentation take element whether guitar delay keyboard whatever might repurposing way kind parallel do create music music create suggest state time possible played different analog equipment sequencer use played minimal influence compose record whatever think call might audience course experience know direction could go intention like course accepted thought kind transition classic call call classic minimalism endbeginningtechno time whatever however may call modern electronics kind bridge think present music perform live many time last year whatever might many time laugh perform though perform start club different environment yes perform many year thought impossible equipment bring carry install tune studio use mix desk use tape record delay drum machine synthesizer thought studio record would never perform technology change interested course first computer technology beginningused apple ii plus computer use commodore computer rough simple computer course possible work even play computer like instrument take another year laptop get technically fit appropriate program like ableton fantastic use stage play play like plan instrument start think perform solo performance simple equipment give possibility perform japan perform korea perform china perform australia perform united state take laptop small keyboard guitar work little different version use original sound separate track two track exist record multi track use part many many small part keep original sound second way use internal computer sound synthesizer sound plug in rebuild bass line chorus solo melody drum set use drum sample original echo drum computer old melody new play attractive played first concert japan since think perform every year like around hear music different way time hear different try keep close much original perform always perform quite exactly minute structure every time different favorite way music use explain sometimes basic structure structure begin improvise want open question moment obviously work lot thing addition present music compose score whatnot wonder term start conversation term talk context context start think taught anything term context fuel creation something yet thing come specific set circumstance germany berlin youth creates something people little direct connection still attachment still feel connection wonder thought complicate question laugh repeat begin free play intend much become professional interested music music music exist play sound like like listen something radio make play guitar home sound completely different work interested side interested music yes music structure difference major minor

anybody question manuel please participant point thank hi thank much share music inspire since record call invention electric guitar really like think still chance electric guitar reinvent yes course try example come mind idea produce every sound could imagine want guitar give form structure chosen minimalistic approach put composition yes course follow anymore do intention continue hear e e second part use pure guitar sound distortion effect even echo pure guitar cable mix desk beautiful sound reduce produce sound finger depends attack finger play nail play small pick move finger left hand great variety tonality atmosphere change color tone enough future found attractive today many effect effect effect good say echo use effect use part composition possibility example use kind looper live sampler create new style something looping put loop together work one two voice three voice maybe hi thank talk u music inspire want ask ever use alternative guitar tuning understand alternative guitar tuning alternative guitar tuning tuning yeah yes invention want play bass kind low voice bass line tune e string try something yes sometimes special chord easy translate transform another harmony try tuning use classic tune time return use train start improvise want think much note rest would play much head play special composition yes example make tune hawaii guitar pedal steel hawaiian guitar different tuning use play chord several possibility try yes hi thank wonder decide record like release improvise lot make decision yeah sometimes easy begin easy time one record use laugh studio time course start old studio start old studio invention example lucky finish track two track fourth track limit technology limit say okay enough add instrument whatever danger later year technology get big track track track terrible musician really think fill track still space yeah never reduce eight track jeff say find minimalism way reduce element put another drum track another violin another piano reduce concentrate composition think classic old composer compose piece cello compose piece one violin one violin big orchestra express everything one voice matter self control think excerpt played invention electric guitar sound incredibly fresh really date think see lot relevance kind contemporary post rock curious approach people would take make kind music would much base loop pedal wonder make composition minute long say sit play part vision part go start one layer improvisation build picture head beforehand well track could use four track four voice think basic theme try play explain record start develop voice sometimes use kind second voice bass something contrast first second voice think process step step start later basis minute get mood think test try today easy put note basic sequence try long want point year pre record basic sequence way rewind tape start begin show kind diagram thought maybe one another part divide part change change harmony part atonal part go back rhythmic rocky part end first piece yeah structure step step far remember think could ask one small thing say notate afterwards live performance curious way say use delay effect part composition notate delay part classical convention kind thing yeah easy explain echo delay nothing special time use pink floyd big band jimi hendrix studio never really work play exactly sync echo mean echo delay control tempo piece also great help played keep steady temp want exactly amount echo first delay second delay third delay give new combination note give new harmony give new interval third note meet third one something like like phase yeah hello thank wonder somebody inspire lot contemporary artist musician newer music artist interested moment inspire particular actually listen much music try find work something new new structure style electronic could anything found bit sad electronic music become little much like dance music either dance chill think many many possibility electronic sound music fine precise work make everything make different acoustic music old music use bit miss something like happeneds minimal music depend instrument could electronic
