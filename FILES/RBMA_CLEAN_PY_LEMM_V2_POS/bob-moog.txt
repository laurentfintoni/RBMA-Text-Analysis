let give warm welcome mr bob moog couple month ago found quite recommendable book hold vintage synthesizer somewhere really stupid bookstore funnily enough little article someone call bob moog go minimoog ultimate antique analog could chance read first sentence see long time well say nearly quarter century ago minimoog first hit street begin last decade moog music ceremoniously slap brass plaque last mini assembly line sent fetch inflate price write well wonder yet instrument distinctive sound much u today particularly fat three oscillator bass sound transcend novelty fashion become timbral staple join small number instrument hammond b organ rhodes electric piano two come mind keyboard hall fame applause well remember write less right laugh people might one two great thing life make synthesizer dream little kid get fascination thing weird word like oscillator modulation freaky stuff start kid get electronics especially electronics make sound say electronics like electronics today electronics one two vacuum tube couple resistor couple capacitor big fat transformer could put whole thing together kitchen table hobby kid play baseball nearly everybody else beating either really like electronics father one first amateur radio operator remembers day vacuum tube power battery seem avant garde modern way today seem natural grown computer digital stuff electronics grow seem natural ever since go play around transistor kitchen table building theremin back world trade center even world trade center section downtown manhattan mart electronic part thing tokyo today call akihabara little stall one buy resistor tube microprocessor like food market five green transistor yeah hobby go bronx high school science new york city good school still learn lot science even well beat nerd laughter go go engineering school love sound music thing come back well learn basic school whole business sound design sort middle become important part music right people help people think begin almost year ago met experimental composer back experimental composer meant reel reel tape recorder razor blade splice tape begin anything else could get record little segment sound either microphone electronic stuff extra sure tape recorder first person work herb deutsch music teacher hofstra university long island vision make music tape recorder experimental thing audience maybe hundred people new york city knew electronic music met herb music teacher conference turn use theremin built class ear training sight sing ask knew anything electronic music thought well know electronics hobby music take music lesson say yes know electronic music know electronic music idea learn quickly herb couple time ask could help make new sound ask mind make mouth sound like bee boo bee boo whee oo whee oo like begin thought knew transistor new knew technical property ask idea come make call voltage control oscillator vco voltage control amplifier vca thought way many think put tune mix together sort idea come hell vco us moog voyager play barely audible low tone look see speaker go vibrate response electrical voltage go oscillator go keyboard oscillator go faster faster play high note octave high note piano oscillator voltage control oscillator back engineer technician want oscillator get test equipment catalog saw picture big box knob front set knob frequency want want change frequency turn knob different frequency really good want one frequency one exact frequency good musician music change sound include change frequency kind hard play big knob like accurately instead knob oscillator place plug something control sound manipulate hand glide keyboard pitch glide way do keyboard change electrical voltage low high back high low turn knob call glide rate slows step would normally get play keyboard sort thing musician instrument designer learn jobnobody understand vcos possible close relationship musician people experiment stuff engineer come new concept back u knew enough music able talk musician u actually musician one person lot work right around time begin buchla still fantastic design musician well engineer buchla musical vision help musician thing talk say u sound like pretty exclusive club pretty small begin couple engineer come around eventually join company people like jim scott bill hemsath name extremely well know happen mooglore heard name italian television engineer name paolo ketoff design instrument call synket earlyworked lot musician think similar engineer like work musician ironically enough call military industrial complex bad development lot musical instrument well second world war whole field electronics advanced incredibly interestingly enough tape recorder invent germany use second world war think manufacturer call magnetophon couple american soldier brought back one magnetophons happen engineer work company california call ampex manufacture motor brought back strange contraption motor figure ampex could find something use motor new invention tape recorder basically tape recorder get start usa favourite album would go moog sound proud contribute gosh many back interest audience member suggests switch bach wendy carlos well switch bach carlos record come seminal think right word show could do nobody understood start something conventional wisdom music business latecould make synthesizer make funny sound ear catch effect could put radio commercial experimental music make real music course know real music ask anybody know real music people music business knew real music real music music make real money laughter carlos record make real money people understood could use thing produce play realise whatever word want use music important novel first time people really want listen satisfied need music valuable people switch bach still sell today large sell classical record time long period thousand musician around world understood seem something make music torsten schmidt quickly word spread emerson lake palmer begin tour word spread pretty fast still point view perspective small company manufacturing thing cheap lot stuff inside nothing cheap back everything analog take grant want good sound keyboard spend thousand dollar lot money back first time show trade show music merchant convention chicago remember show music retailer would come look long face say say synthesizer laughter show knob knob usually say something like expect sell store expect musician understand would walk away look arp model voyager something strike instantly texture thing material use like wood design something suppose sound sci fi futuristic retro earthy look never idea suppose sound never anybody goal sound like something already existence every musician work different musical vision work different area music musically keep thing general possible synth design make specific sort sound nice wood case big fat wheel light blue feel good musician average person need thing feel good even use one little g computer see place feel good g feel well pc important musician sense try get front panel keyboard happens turn knob feel good musician begin almost place voyager market year everything original model quite bit one important feature entire front panel store digital memory recall instantly moog wife make comment audience ileana keep focus laugh call sound change one knob knob gonna anything part sound knob begin pick mind work keith emerson mind learn turn knob hand analytical mind like envision underlie structure read manual understand sound begin oscillator three oscillator section panel one oscillator say oscillator top one two three play different effect select pitch range waveform torsten schmidt waveform start oscilloscope show shape vibration time waveform come explanation short teach stuff school never understand anyway pretty brief well stuff help musician unless worry circuit work worry exactly name waveform mean important waveform spectrum harmonic associate hear quality change waveform hear quality change demonstrates little drawing waveform one call triangular one call sawtooth look like teeth saw another one call square wave another one call rectangular wave go continuously one way original minimoog demonstrates one oscillator two oscillator set interval musician know interval three oscillator demonstrates know exactly interval set major triad tune three note chord want include unison make play three oscillator note one two three hear difference oscilloscope look waveform would see constantly change three wave beating slowly technical waveform orient description musician mean fat sound demonstrates fat thin applause ok talk eight knob three waveform three octave clickers two frequency knob let call interval instead basic oscillator way interconnect know time let go take care section another section call mixer three oscillator mix play note continuously mix one strong three change play addition another source sound pitch sound call noise combination filter creates effect without oscillator fifth one call external jack back plug sound source guitar turntable output mixer theremin anything shape rest stuff hang plug whatever signal get still fuck around bob moog yeah yeah sure want take home sure want take home make offer refuse joking speak michael beforehand ok section right call filter one electronic operation associate analog synthesizer general moog synthesizer particular filter happens turn knob filter demonstrates cut high harmonic first low one finally left fundamental pitch sine wave filter like oscillator voltage control demonstrates use slow vibration open close filter instead hand lfo thing u heard project name warp record duo lfo knew speaker rattle lfo lfo lfo lfo low frequency oscillator laughter rave level see ok let play nice fat sound like turn lfo knob able change harmonic way sort heightens fatness sound particularly give something expressive give sound motion right rate right amount enhance music filter another control happens call resonance case filter emphasis particular pitch filter filter give filter sense pitch demonstrates without resonance resonance actually two filter hear two resonance listen closely hear one come one speaker one others output stereo knob change shape filter move sound around player control something set exact number leave alone play thing put key put hand one hear effect know keith emerson even even use listen thing pick individual knob guess fancy stuff middle would help store thing touch surface one way move sound around different knob control device use sound storage recall part digital part route different thing devil advocate new g powerbook less three month away u would still need machine five time big probably eight time heavy answer question g go exactly need others perhaps find easy connect musically satisfy produce music whole thing conceive knob space everything fact switch nice big fat rocker switch design played live interestingly enough yesterday come back steinski seiji lecture go give away valuable information think thing struck talk enslave technology cut whole living everyday life right musical instrument always begin human history use advanced technology time musician need advanced technology appropriate whether need particular advanced technology partially depends kind music want make string instrument developed around three four hundred year ago precision woodworking high technology brass instrument developed really high quality brass ability machine create thin accurate material brass piano come existence along manufacturing technology u piano likely hi tech mechanical manufacture product ever home brass instrument wood instrument mechanical instrument developed th century technology time electronics u analog electronics increasingly computer digital electronics instrument th century use advanced technology us one come existence lifetime instance torsten schmidt separate whole analog digital myth debate tool particularly comfortable u whether musician engineer whatever combination sound produce capability control find easy connect instrument doubt lot thing g g lot different function sound quality though sound make difference analog digital part difference explain technical term fact digital waveform update time second still update step whereas nothing step analog waveform everything make sound shape sound analog completely smooth right digital would like go legoland see legoland version house animal matter small brick would still little brick yeah idea search way say go sound strange connect instrument whether guitar violin set drum electronic instrument interaction outside actually go finger connection hesitate use word spiritual force know living thing exert respond sure thing like synthesizer even though living biological sense sense consciousness connect know lot people sure break every tool touch people work sat computer ten minute later work laughter know fact firsthand opposite really want make something work look like go work develop sort connection instrument develop sort connection g g others may find possible instrument like korg triton great stuff like circuitry shaman sort feel good laugh satisfy part something beyond finger know connect even designer even though use make music steinski sit audience musical instrument designer sort stuff happen day intrigue term new device new trend design new electronic instrument go point least digital realm sound possible interest new control device manipulate even novation controller connects midi least interest software inside computer make sound make stuff studio really great know end stuff put cd walk around listen something fairly new human history say hundred year ago even less music something together community activity music live performance benefit group people interact like see aspect music flourish future knock record music listen music go increasingly lonely activity go miss something important human ability get together something community real time
