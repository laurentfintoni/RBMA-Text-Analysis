get well deal best seller label get field best seller label well take leave sir mix lot talk importance publishing read article time make sure publishing especially genre like hip hop much music sample base increase awareness know go use sample track want get paid want give money away kind stuff read interview blaze say fabolous breathe want percent publishing publishing work sample record mean give away publishing pay publishing producer go sample someone else record technically whatever sample part record therefore owe composer original piece music owe like someone come write bassline write lyric old record sample mean less important part integral part track owe person money unfortunately whole game gotten hand virtually impossible independent label go clear sample like use able

business kind stuff yeah right tell u story first real quickly tell u rewind project rewind series come honest learn mistake around long business long time try push notion label boundary could old school soul could new school jazz could latin music could brazilian music fun try put feel compilation series call category category thought would encapsulate everything little bit everything dj might pick track play club listener average joe go record store could pick put stereo home something would take obnoxious standpoint pure club record nice kind mixtape situation category never really take ok get volume five cut hard push concept discover compilation really good concept concept really super strong call compilation category strong enough complete opposite think compilation market pretty good would nice keep thing definitely different kind way sell label artist type release brainwave cover version rewind would good title cause root old school reggae dj situation thought ask favorite band cover version could old could new initially thought own right remix old record eventually series become create new version old track scratch currently work volume five get people cover everyone frank zappa lead zeppelin michael jackson say schedule clear record finish mixed beautifully ready go minimum number month amount time realistically go take get everything ready get street work four

region copy good single might sell somewhere five ten thousand copy single sell thousand ok name little bit fan base kind alright reckon calculate estimate go sell five thousand ten thousand record new much money signing sign base single much would pay put ok let different one track album go sell five ten thousand record five ten thousand probably many mean really like luv n haight record luv n haight record might expect somewhere range five ten thousand record back five ten thousand record sell cause risk take john arnold record many sell luv n haight record always sell less ubiquity record
