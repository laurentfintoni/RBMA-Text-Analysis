fortunate man u prolifically small way responsible lot music record collection last year mr john dent applause understand go discuss u side music production may may know much important look forward discover mystery master please feel free ask question later think john first go present information put together purpose hand thing john thank much go talk couple subject first one master actually want master record mostly go discussion quality issue introduction mp ipod internet downloads easy lose sight fact original master significantly high quality listen number demonstration one particularly good one album master band call zero actually put material onto vinyl acetate make cd everything album actually go onto lathe sideline ask cut single actually cut single direct half inch tape digitize actually hear resolution difference two come bit later also prepared album single sleeve material work last year do hurry literally grabbed pile record cd scan day actually hand quite proud actually surprised go go start play couple piece music afters simple term go hear louder big version original actually way look go buy finish cd finish piece vinyl generally master somebody somewhere look overall record level work artist get cross fade relative track level right overall sound quality generally kept high possibly kind spoil put cd cd player get keep change volume keep get alter tone engineer like actually supervise process make track people absorbed content look instrumentation arrangement general vibe track people bring stuff tell try say tell try actually happens make comparison stuff literally come fresh studio stuff played radio bought everybody sometimes absolutely enormous difference people bring really want role supervise process try put influence pas experience say people oh need need show people number way way work quite broad large palette equipment method use result people actually quite stagger get engineer spent year work come go hell get db track already peaked zero sound compress limited suppose skill art engineer like put year experience work generally select equipment engineer use plug in unless particular job require equipment outboard equipment high quality analog equipment modify supply fine designer planet people like sound go equipment without sometimes good one thing happens go play couple thing do recently first one play particular one kook single british chart recently first one copy master come state mike brown mixed music kook move way brief job strange bottom end thing make radio transmitter pop actually change dynamic volume record rather strange way filter also duplicate kind level album master album radio version get approve played uk radio music kook move way radio version applause recording peak digital cd zero difference master energy sound pressure everyone tap foot sound almost less like demo sort thing actually common effect common factor lot work actually quite dramatic track new scritti politti album green home studio engineer spent good year make record come actually brought mix rig studio give second room course year recently finish work issue within perhaps vocal come loud raise gain would go back actually reduce vocal mix slightly give back collaboration kind way become part production process record go play two minute quite dramatic music scritti politti boom boom bap unmastered version master version music scritti politti boom boom bap master version applause work wonderful music get well energy accessible work well work fantastically do without plug in think message behind everyone make music generally want success lot people make music everywhere presentation delivery music involve enough make record music know delivery important engineer like specialize field actually start record studio intention record decide stick start vinyl disc cut incorporate cd master cd master come record stuff need kind decide want perhaps one track fifty receive studio actually hardly anything music need kind attention master stage may simple level exercise track album someone get record technique together may need actually dramatic approach hand studio good half inch tape recorder actually take data file reproduce really high quality digital analogue converter use valve converter equipment feel get well energy transistor one quite often put material onto tape start make cd taped version scritti politti one go route put tape suddenly elevate sound quite considerably also vinyl disc cut lathe studio tend use similar equipment work vinyl system well cd plug patch different way artist actually choice decide want whatever hear vinyl part hear cd collection cd record onto vinyl put cd go stage actually press put onto vinyl acetate vinyl acetate aluminium disc skin side nitrous acetate material bit like nail varnish fairly soft cut groove silent hardly hear anything people really appreciate buy record pick crackle scuff whatever actual disc cut process good fairly noise free record information hi fi deck converter people chosen make cd effective reach computer get various order thing think listen thing people do get guy well know producername tim friese greene work talk talk also write talk talk couple year ago doubt hit life co write use service probably extreme session long time remixing remixing get home studio similar way way guy work digital workstation bring bit data file specifically ask go onto tape onto cut lathe order make record go good month replace track building album month start bring vocal overdubs guitar part also want put tape lathe work analog system timing equipment may exactly precise digital equipment get guitar part back computer kind time stretch bit make sure fit building layer layer complete album play bit do sound normally hear cd tim friese greene one track go name heligoland music heligoland unknown go tim friese greene another character come actually builder dream make record get bass player band bass player record engineer mix engineer name wally artist call sir walter give couple day time produce album know sign record label dream record base building website also vinyl try different route actually vinyl route really suit especially bass play music sir walter unknown heard record decide try create something view fairly authentic sort style listen one band band grand national stuff sound bit like police actually cut roxanne long time ago police three turn session blonde haired lad record cut roxanne put stuff vinyl record home rupert originally mixed data file decide later date replace track mix quarter inch tape kind authentic way police recording would mix modern style mix sample hear come music grand national unknown one thing concern lot engineer like within industry way everyone listen much low grade music day really everyone listen move understand happen great concern whole generation actually go lose sight fact historically record music really superior quality give fact figure lot master recording actually record tape good quality half inch tape approximately four time resolution cd whenever record half inch tape make cd basic sound subtlety start get lose reduce mp format actually listen approximately thirtieth cd work sound change actually quite considerable work experience guy couple week ago never listen vinyl listen mp actually brought record played shock actually look shock face say go go buy turntable never gonna rely message make music whilst nothing wrong low quality sound use creative thing mean lot people use beat slightly crusty sound whatever nothing wrong would advise stage look high quality listen system find show clearly actually choose sound people record sound know mark pritchard actually hire record studio brought drummer bass player actually record sound order sample create decent sound dance record people take stuff internet pinch stuff cd generally quality end downward direction lot sound studio hear end spectrum think creatively problem whatever want aware world superb quality know good idea actually aware wherever try audition stuff good system headphone computer speaker actually take trouble actually get full frequency range speaker system use tool use way actually grade decide probably lead get comparison vinyl cd zero project talk cd actual record vinyl b source record half inch tape cd sound like vinyl sound like music zero future cd vinyl comparison could anyone hear difference laugh yes process exactly decide go either lp cd explain master half inch master record analog multi track half inch master replayed get specialist machine studio analog hi fi designer uk tim de paravicini reputation within professional audio field design tape machine replay electronics use case vinyl literally plug analog eq couple db analog limit go plug cut system digitize liken potato chip vinyl potato cd chip history record sound recording come analog know grow bought lot record listen analogue record system found bit strange digital come something almost perfect politics sort stuff come play cd see delivery point view cd pop crackle mathematically technically cd quarter resolution vinyl hear element demonstration think mp could th cd lose vinyl still relevant medium high resolution medium think lot people really appreciate fact high resolution medium mean spent half hour morning listen different record player cartridge want make sure could actually hear demonstration pick use record player important need spend little bit money get record lot people technics sl deck concordes stanton stylus actually probably hearing record hi fi lot hi fi base record deck extract every ounce information vinyl high resolution medium think lot people swear still lot artist insist material still vinyl come like know much rather listen vinyl cd inaudible question audience member oh actually finish process cd henry binns heard tape cut vinyl decide actually would whole album put onto acetate beyond played back high quality hi fi deck convert digital beyond room definitely digitize process loses detail chop sound sample process source wonder much cd bit dvd audio would far well bit yes much well would roughly well get lot high resolution source quite artist produce source imagine slider scale cd good quality analog high resolution digital closer analog end would recommend work work high resolution whatever set workstation mean practical issue start go beyond k sample rate least work bit difference move closer analog actually another format super audio cd invent brought another attempt get kind closer record industry get back vinyl vinyl towards end reach peak talk year development lot reputable company perfect way recording make go cd take step backwards lot equipment quite crude nowadays lot stuff learn lot phase correction lot work put converter actually initially convert much high sample rate sample back k cd type converter use think message aware quality difference affect work definitely affect work suppose sort touch get list thing general advice make track one thing would suggest everyone make music within certain genre style put input track already mp go buy cd place track workstation make comparison kind thing every day people bring track aware may think get loud sound big sound maybe monitoring loud turn monitor listen commercial cd go back might think oh might need work bit harder get work right aware compare number two work high quality send work master studio ideally send high quality data file studio deal reputable studio deal data file lot stuff internet get client world ftp site set secure daily basis client move file backwards forward get site master send back approval kind thing master become easy international thing u one thing do studio studio call loud way obvious reason decide name go make living team two studio website call master world little bit c v engineer choice operate site different price different engineer different availability get lot work one week job turkey something india german football song know kind stuff come internet quite interest also advise attend master session possible learn lot every engineer master different work differently people train common element strive get best recording learn especially vinyl vinyl easily distort medium thing hear vinyl instance sibilant quality voice singer actually record vinyl well remember start queen house band studio start freddie mercury voice record vinyl well big effort make find right microphone right way get sound onto vinyl vocal spit sibilant quite distraction attend master session simply come away information help next mix next record one issue quite lot client really hammer mix maximise quite often l computer want impress everybody maximise think nothing wrong try see effect lot master studio master engineer include horrify sometimes someone give something anything good example dance music vinyl maximise track give good level people realise intro balance people kick drum intro three time loud within track kind weird balance everything kind sparse stuff loud stuff loud actually suppress aware effect large degree irreversible use limit maximise program aware overdo lot people actually send one like maximise another mix slightly less none actually chance apply skill equipment aware kill record quite significantly overdo quite often give demo cd send record company decent level otherwise get heard aware need mix slightly less fierce thing advise sure cd go come vinyl go come couple variation mix common variation happens lot album engineer producer give master mix vocal vocal mix common reason give ability cut paste version create interest track use vocal verse master one chorus kind thing track amplify lot master process thing like vocal may come consequence actually loud fall back vocal version quite often sound well mark pritchard mark brought sort snare version hip hop bass bass know think mark go bit mad know nice bit variation go use master process quite creatively people bring workstation might stem quickly piece together sub mix plug laptop work recently coldcut album one track mixed actually powerful bass call stem actually kind remixed master room make much fuller track track album prepare master stage need master engineer prepared accept master engineer tolerate kind thing
