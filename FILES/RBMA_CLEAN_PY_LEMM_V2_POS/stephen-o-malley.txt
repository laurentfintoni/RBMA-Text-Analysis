call ircam paris collaborate basically creates number simulated acoustic space could room could acoustic space like forest canyon small room various thing move sound source field stuff like theoretical practical actually pretty interest way collaborate light light director patrick would bring depth field close could tell stage like ten metre deep whatever make move would seem like could sensation depth opening stuff like get really inspire brought spatialisation tool use composition music try complement sound well work tool little bit deceptive micro manage every aspect audience experience first time even learn much effective suggest something make precise movement sound space example rather something move accomplishes sort sensation audience chance need employ patience skill like ok hold need whizz bang every moment exactly work new piece actually call pyre premiere next month france use spatialisation use bit differently much simple way actually programmer building space faders like ok want large outdoor space whatever bring spatialisation stuff possible ableton max live stuff algorithm algorithm reverb lot multi channel stuff ableton spatialisation people engineer work ircam guy make multi channel stuff new ableton manuel poletti name use ableton quite bit theatre stuff yeah great useful diffusion like call playback yeah yeah kind know answer way curious come
