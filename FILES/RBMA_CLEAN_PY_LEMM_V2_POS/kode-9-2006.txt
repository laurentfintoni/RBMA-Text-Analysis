steve gurley el b zed bias kind bassline side garage kind go direction way suppose feature rinse one way another rinse held together latter form uk garage eventually become thing kind two separate scene number people occupy kind space middle plasticman plastician come grime side thing kind dabbles dubstep kind opposite dubstep dabble bit grime seem like bit regional thing well like grime south beneath london tend think people london infatuate local area alien london outsider kind slightly different perspective fuss play stuff east london south london like four mile away big deal mention say many time year role pirate radio play give people idea important pirate radio get dubstep particular end nuum literally way work last year number dj rinse fm occasionally thing work properly pirate station stream online people record people record show immediately go live local area web site call barefiles com huge archive grime dubstep radio show kind connection local pirate radio station web archive mix kind quite amaze fuel injection music spread internationally well mean lot people via web site particular yeah definitely right talk dmz thing every scene historically epicenter like paradise garage blue co op know happen broken beat thing another call fwd played vital role rise dubstep yeah original dark garage night way every two week thursday start sunday night velvet room char cross road move plastic people shoreditch east london really tiny little club get amaze sound system think thing dubstep kind spoil sound system get plastic people fwd every friday night dmz sound system mass brixton sound system want bass music word clear sound system physical experience everything vibrate thing slide across surface whole place vibrate dubstep really work unless everything shake vibe like digital mystikz night told like pretty much get light dark really light dark room everything vibrate strip minimal simple like sound whereas grime thing certain degree much mc like mention dubstep much find mc night fwd yeah mean fwd always mixture grime dubstep sometimes lucky hear grime mc dubstep vice versa mc dubstep kind keep company music alongside music time stuff bit strange dubstep work vocalist call spaceape long since right first release kind weird let listen yeah cover prince sign time let take get grab record get nice play word tune call sine dub gotten beat think get actually laptop kind bass effect vocal vocal kind dub poetry style music kode spaceape sine dub applause abouts meet spaceape old friend mine first track together quick thing like half hour never do vocal like get vocal quickly somewhere start favorite track go get record get record lyric lyric read lyric put quick bass thing effect boom put voice bit initial reaction tune people bit really fit anywhere obviously tempo fine play set deliberately like people kinda heard kind connection berlin dub people like rhythm sound also time grime thing call devil mix people like wiley make track bass beat mc would spit people make connection berlin dub people thought connection devil mix grime random really obviously someone else come little bit later end label whose seem like obvious connection burial tell u little burial burial like guy kind gotten contact start web magazine really side uk garage send tune five six year four five year put last year press sell quite quickly cool kept send stuff like clearly man put album put album right around may kind music quite stagger feedback well sell really fit anywhere definitely tangent dubstep sound kind vaguely reminiscent berlin lot uk guy think quite dark melancholy one thing kind touch whole thing lack much mc host dubstep night think one big problem drum bass especially mc night music become rewinds many rewinds get sudden producer make tune sudden revolve around heavy impact drop actually construct tune agree something possibly happen grime correlation mc kind style generally really like mc like play mc lot people dubstep kind instrumental music really like everybody get theory anything go wrong jungle drum bass different theory around thing anything anymore issue mc certain side take side loud noisy aggressive rhythmically really stupid really simple boring consider jungle come rhythmically excite music heard life could end like weird fo long many producer talk fact maybe fabio touch yesterday lecture music bpm much space breathe music slow little bit space breathe could inject much life think dubstep certain degree offer bit solution think definitely counterbalance drum bass go faster faster towards gabber around bpm also lot stuff half step actually go even slow definitely drawn lot people away drum bass definitely kind counterbalance way drum bass evolve remember interview lemon dillinja moan fast everything get say gonna stuff think like peer pressure dancefloor drug raver crave demand overwhelm pressure guy earn living heard many people try slow really anything get even faster another thing kind interest always sub genre sudden get split micro genre say half step thing start see even dubstep new little side genre pop exactly half step example dubstep lot different rhythmic style think half step one simplest style get lot space mix perfect sound little bit like instrumental grime production value different sub bass much strong feel quite slow play track spaceape kind half step thing thing half step bass drive music along oppose drum drum quite space track call backward earlier year music kode spaceape backward applause actually kind weird feel slow actually people go big style dance actually dance half almost like imagine fast music add double time kind like thing people jungle certain degree opposite jungle jungle yeah slow dub reggae bass line double time break almost like dubstep double time break subtract actually quite sparse almost sluggish people people dance double time people really lock anyway lot lazy skank go people properly lock dance double time kind weird watch quite slow music yeah right mean many producer half step moment yeah probably best half step producer way like proto typical half step sound guy call loefah get huge brick wall bass sparse minimal rhythm know one thing go ask well kind seem grime kick lot young producer allow growth music much come fact young kid easy access basic software like fruityloops mean example would production set look like still lot people produce fruity yeah think lot kid still mean skream go week think still stuff fruity stuff get fruity amaze use use fruity year ago produce age use pretty much use anything standardly reason logic think really matter software use mean skream particular kind best example really matter get get fruityloops cool obviously bass heavy music mean good set monitor essential part kit yeah kind standard mean hardest thing music kind reference sound like studio sound like huge sound system music really easy overdo bass studio get dubplates cut place south london know describe place call transition describe bass management often mold bass like hold back little bit bring control little bit work work big system effectively cut dub reggae age jungle dubstep stuff kind interest know know happen technology available pretty much every genre music everyone go direction serato drum bass dj pretty much last bastion certain degree dubplate culture yet seem whole culture alive well dubstep mean strong dubstep certainly anti digital stuff know prefer sound vinyl like sound dubplates mind bit crackle music dubplates last play quite quickly start get crackle think kind useful way building sound handful producer cut dubplates word get master early try get master early stage come immediately creates level play field hear stuff compare producer go master process thing quite useful people try build sound building nothing really like invent new variant hardcore continuum talk mean know drum bass music house spot dubstep transition forest hill south london mean cost side thing mean obviously cut plate know economically stack yeah mean everyone love pound cut dubplate two track fifty pound yeah real maniacal dubplate cutter like spend much money nobody particularly make lot money everybody seem quite happy put money sound kind way thing work say example someone get book play fwd turn cd wallet probably people play cd especially sound system like plastic people beautiful sound system sound clean room cool really like cd hurt ear toppy sound sharp come cd think like think know maybe one downside people stuff fruity go straight cd without master mean also get element kind vip culture well special one offs maybe close friend dj yeah certain extent mean cut dubplate make tune cut dubplate one day know people kind little different version different occasion lot money scene everybody special people general quite happy cut tune go back know production mean process work mean start beat kind work around sample say particular formula usually hear piece music something stay notice three week later hum tune often way work get melodica big augustus pablo fan play instrument melodica kind cool work tune relatively quickly near computer work tune play take computer play midi keyboard whatever kind way make tune like average long would spend tune tune played like day first tune release one without beat sine dub couple hour tune take week kind set rule mean recent time work finish album tell u bit album yeah album call memory future couple week include four five early hyperdub release lot new stuff spaceape kind dark mean find dark people tell dark find quite uplift think bit twist like mean get video get video okay video one track album couple art student make u myspace anyone want watch kind sum video sum quite well get shall listen something album yeah first track album call glass music kode spaceape glass applause term vocalist spaceape work past plan work vocalist release track female jamaican vocalist call warrior queen track album well track bug yeah track release bug warrior queen tell u bit label hyperdub go long three year three year first set essentially mean see label production yeah specifically production knew slightly weird necessarily go fit label really plan avenue release stuff kind naturally happens hear people stuff bit weird well think could take interest direction release bug warrior queen thing release burial stuff still mainly want term production avenue put without persuade someone like something else quite interest talk yesterday talk anyone run label day news good funnily enough sale go rather go recent time yeah big label go right direction even vinyl sale go cool day age vinyl sale go cd sale great reason think vinyl experience little bit resurgence lot people suffer one way another tiny label start building like think aspiration lot realistic perhaps label around long time experienced vinyl different period lifespan therefore practically suicidal happen vinyl sale digital stuff think kind parallel maybe fact talk lot support vinyl dubplate culture within dubstep young people go gig actually see guy play plate rather serato cd keep whole vibe alive think true certain degree maybe maybe think way scene grow lot clone go word people come hear music first time see core scene copy copy sound copy mannerism copy fact use dubplates scene grow way music work way everything work one way another way something grows small big must involve element copying yeah think impact craze dubplate fetishist start see scene emerge outside london outside uk production see much production come far corner globe yeah good little scene berlin new york played brazil next month suppose russia china japan term production still best stuff come south london heard amaze track holland recently good stuff come germany u people brazil make stuff sometimes like less copying thing people bring local flavor local music scene music maybe take bit time head russia pretty soon well know local music scene would russia something else note course well respect producer also well respect writer write book little halfway tell u sound interest book us abuse sound system book call sonic warfare range everything mc clash soundclashes use sound system kind competitive conflictual situation use vocal cord respect right u military research acoustic weaponry iraq really full spectrum people use abuse sound system people use sound control manipulate write fair bit stuff sonic branding thing call earworms earworms basically catchy tune get stuck head try get head stick think think musician know lot earworms kind weird lot military research like science fiction basically quite believe attempt try sound commercially available device uk call mosquito know anyone heard basically buy device shopkeeper buying example fit outside shop basically target year old base principle kind joke sound like joke sound like science fiction base principle get old lose high frequency hearing device emits mean use device apparently get rid rat mouse use device group youth sensitive frequency range hz upper end audible frequency spectrum suppose annoy go away disperse lot case use sound either high volume sound high frequency sound low frequency sound make people feel uneasy usually disperse crowd really know sound realistic get little test try basically one website device mosquito get test tone hz right gauge hearing see hearing bit fuck lot high frequency hear lot high frequency play tone see people hear science behind say get old lose high frequency therefore device affect middle age people affect kid press release image website commercial device kid hood top smoking cigarette play frequency see people hear expect many people hear unless closet dog hz play hz anyone hear play hz old play hz heard hear play hz could hear one go like principle device suppose work say kind science fictional kind make think lose contact line science fiction reality device market long research book oh quite long time something squeeze kind busy schedule last year hopefully get finish next month producer go whole process try get record release one thing try get book publish another look forward part thing yeah set record label cut middleman bit music industry go set publishing company would long another couple thing term heard coin use whole thing ecology fear explain also bass materialism sound pretty interest want explain little bit simply bass materialism thing book quite theoretical bass materialism kind like ok year western philosophy whenever engages music one way another kind classical music art music bass materialism like drop bass bomb top western philosophy see happens thing ecology fear ecology fear basically background book particularly post fear dominant mechanism politics work globally look aspect via way use sound last whatever year produce fear obviously horror film classic example kind shrill sound also something come dub reggae culture relationship dread bass culture kind thing yeah right anyone question moment sorry forgot yeah back story sonic warfare bit animal massive rat problem original studio one record tago mago vitamin c kind stuff like earlyholger czukay go get rid mouse rat turn one oscillator really high frequency two day later animal go whole problem four five day later group go massive outrage one big argument group almost split someone come conclusion machine still go switch become happy work place yeah kind thing get lot conspiracy theory search net stuff acoustic weaponry hear story science lab suddenly everybody start feel ill nauseous lab nobody could work realize one ventilator fan emit infra sound infrasonic frequency really low frequency basically connect different part body different resonant frequency eyeball vibrate certain frequency seem like hallucination basically eyeball vibrate get vision like hz something like load story people unexplainable nausea feeling thing look stuff online lot conspiracy theory surround quite difficult separate reality bullshit obviously anyone interested bassy music heard stuff brown note certain low frequency allegedly suppose make run toilet question example france paris quite one know dubstep close london explain fact example scene like uk garage grime touch country town like paris know mean played paris time people think tell think french quite protectionist come culturally country could really compare place like germany usually quite open music come london yeah example drum bass uk hip hop like root manuva ninja tune big dada think still even though music six year old still strange way quite young six year old actually like year half old go number change recently make maybe accessible visible explain paris thing played couple time ok question favorite reggae track two get two favorite reggae track play play midcalled king tubby meet rocker uptown dub king tubby augustus pablo dub jacob miller tune music king tubby augustus pablo king tubby meet rocker uptown augustus pablo melodica get enough favorite kind reggae related tune comesactually one first digital dancehall track think
