life enactment lose translation go fun go lose either way whether japanese german english today talk physic physic behind sound well give big hand dear translator booth hiding behind wall great honor japan talk wonderful machinery make wonderful sound two accomplish gentleman different generation probably lot common please join welcome nishijima san takahashi san work place speak cultural difference folk back home would call korg pronounce korgu go home friend brag pronounce properly bit interest story way company come together actually end work study electronic engineering college also music circle campus band nothing serious chose work korg could utilize knowledge music engineering music circle university played hard rock progressive rock favorite progressive rock band pink floyd king crimson emerson lake palmer like big soundscapes get involve join korg late like mr nishijima background electrical engineering much focus sound general engineering course include electrical stuff always actually even get music building circuit make sound well since kid actually start build stuff sequencer oscillator stuff like synth experimental noise make stuff finish uni know bumming around year europe building stuff one day dawn get proper job thought well korg korg cool stuff look korg happen japan japanese thought well great excuse move japan get paid kind thing mr nishijima guess different situation get involve lot information start kind available guess back mean machine get front make time lot exploratory right m release one emulate version go market last year original size one decide build small version m mini release last year work machine one first assignment first join korg fruit labor original model circuit machine basically design fumio mieda pioneer japanese synthesizer actually still work u korg today arrange circuit mieda design create first model tailor mass produce factory take exact design use part backalso modern engineering recreate machine m mini release last year still analog yes completely analog pretty much circuit engineer component get today add original come come software plugins emulate m work well quite intersting span year engineer original engineer plugins engineer small size think quite unique experience engineer think anyone else do especially since also work legacy collection software else software synthesizer release yes believe initially three u team think go sell fun experiment u begin build software thing time get sound become hungry want make well signal processing learn university get way decide ignore rule kind strange thing say decide set rule aside main objective rebuild hardware use software great challenge use analog circuit simulate software korg patent call cmt short component component model technology utilize create legacy collection software someone work field software field hand analog stuff fierce debate sometimes almost religious do actually sound well pro con software computer call cpu cpu efficient first built software use modern cpu definitely upgrade sound work even today believe analog cannot outdone analog give well quality work develop software raise speed compute capacity maximum possible mimic analog sound theory unfortunately present computer performance yet nutshell even consider rapid increase compute possibility still good enough could somehow explain layman term actual difference analog signal digital signal yeah go could show could switch screen mac difference analog digital synth inside look quite different circuit monotron thing right probably one simplest analog synths around basically make capacitor resistor transistor diode fet maybe four five different component use make synth part circuit example vco vco make original raw waveform demonstrates sound raw sound vco modulate circuit component call c basically charge reset charge really fast rate like hz something becomes tone play music analog synth actually create signal current voltage whereas digital synth create calculation regular interval time care musician fundamentally different digital realm finite number calculation minimum span interval calculate ultimately determine resolution sound rather signal completely define whole cycle waveform discrete point join line instead see finite resolution work digital domain little bit like know wave instead step stair well staircase often portrayed way set dot join line allow within bandwidth bad square step yeah see finite number dot lose resolution think necessarily mean get really bad waveform human ear best hear khz think make analog synths special although analog purist fact work software get rid problem really easily like dc cutoff problem well think analog synths problem find workarounds inadequacy little quirk circuit end give product character go back year look analog synths sound completely different different quirk circuit make sound way way like u human being little quirk ideally make u charm yeah absolutely guess question lot people worried day point calculation fast enough artificial intelligence actually surpasses human think thing go go path laugh yeah think really cool know think interest analogy much processing power need actually make something feel human similar question synthesis much power need make synthesizer really quite organic like analog one think still quite far honest bizarrely enough lot machine use robotic quality time get triple loop headfuck basically want machinery want machinery human really interest sure talk korg release product call miku stomp play guitar vocaloid sings guy know vocaloid might nice explain vocaloid everyone vocaloid technology developed yamaha lab synthesizes voice play someone sing synthetic voice sing go lab research really interest ever heard vocaloid character hatsune miku sound real technology make really real really tell difference real voice synthesize voice good real always paradox get machine want make real want make heart still need machine cool paradox always work think paradox mention human ear capability also hear eight hour club club year little left hear guess lot discussion fetish actual scientific discussion may front u machine machine use people machine artistic ability well least yet music make u human use electronics use equipment make well music everyone could enjoy people still machine note enter korg machine already like part m series say bring machine make different others synthesizer engineer portray design take job think different engineer personally put user shoe think would use product use synthesizer band keep mind user would want would enjoy want simple electrician work need fine instrument honest see craftsman engineer hard translate maestro aim know translate say craftsman engineer guess notion important lot people admire culture country choose path try good particular path possible try get really deep lot repetition research practice go thing translate daily routine year routine change truth work analog circuit difficult issue come work electrical circuit since student still learn next study many decade field go get technical need get electron within transistor electron proton talk study elementary particle level actually fan physic study world elementary particle lead physical property semiconductor bit complicate translate finally could begin understand sound make hand analog circuit elementary particle level level longer sequence tread word stay place analog microscopic level also scatter instead sequence digital scatter first place make digital closer analog need align sequence make possible must raise sample frequency megahertz resolution maybe bit day analog still finer human ear maybe people exceptional hearing people outside music industry day near digital meet analog quality torsten schmidt mean music business one side engineering business guess lot people intimidate physicality physic first place start reading physic realise get level almost like reading philosophy even religion almost recommend reading stuff way lose fear front way lose fear know listen noise perfect example physic make sound think way white noise make within analog synth basically get semi conductor junction usually conduct direction play voltage raise voltage enough energy level break barrier get kind storm electron bursting barrier call avalanche effect think appreciate physic quite good thing sit listen white noise demonstrates white noise electron actually imagine little particle like rain like rain absolutely rain collection discrete drop fall random interval exactly parallel electron say rain use example scientist try organise train station way try organise people flow rush hour look water behaves creek hit stone similar analogy shape sound well water analogy always electronics power supply resistance wire thicker pipe less resistance get current go water analogy much thing start start learn electronics want go back picture second say go nitty gritty detail thing behave would able example look something like go oh know design korg circuit part m good educate guess laugh actually um guess way symbol style way line drawn mr nishijima would first tell good circuit drawn beautifully part craftsmanship representation engineer one happy point year ago say schematic look really good quite happy guess might deserve extra round applause applause may add schematic saw painting work art say painting suppose beautiful order recognize think schematic diagram also beautiful make circuit beautiful diagram could appreciate someone make electrical circuit straight line use shortest distance beautiful could see signal sound flow useless part simplicity good less part less chance break make good design also need strong strong product difference professional amateur design circumstance machine break work pro guess would really bad point incident early something work oh m go give possibility might broken yeah difficulty m think someone hack sent excuse know come full size one come kit assemble whoever assemble something quite interest sound quite good though cause flip signal sometimes thing right good effect yeah absolutely like circuit show something disclose put public domain think month release monotron purpose people get hack although always kind risk disclaimer thing think really good people get hack normal guitarist change pickup change string basically hack basically make instrument personal really glad put people really hack gear mean even stuff release schematic people really get interest stuff pretty modern approach get intellectual property people deal sure sure think great career start time internet probably google m schematic found schematic easy get information probably really treasure look safe somewhere decade ago open thought good u acknowledge officially nishijima san find schematic learn people people work thought oh beautifully do want something like first saw schematic internet old mxr schematic look elegant current mxr old one also schematic sequential circuit prophet seem extremely elegant see beautiful schematic feel creator emotion desire make good instrument think excellent instrument stand test time go history late dr bob moog also believe sort ghost machine subscribe well name doctor oh dr moog great respect dr moog first person introduce electrical instrument synthesizer world admire sorry longer u chance meet dr moog namm show take place year ago maybe year met number well know figure namm show united state sure remember privilege meeting oh mr dave smith think also excellent engineer pretty sure least one person alive appreciate say ghost thing think something living inside machine yes agree dr moog belief design machine put heart schematic really hard explain word see schematic dream think want dream go product becomes ready hit market piece machinery also instrument difference sound compare guitar make craftsman mass produce guitar think electronic circuit make instrument year believe ghost living inside something explain science actually believe exist mean notion thing animate common culture time would say machine ghost part animation machine product design feel like call name since attach know lot people name car well make sense blackboard edition m put wall like chagall something would bit spirit studio way hang like picture say blackboard edition m guess educational purpose wall like chagall artistry spirit whoever work studio yes think would happen buy one buying piece machinery buying part soul soul priceless thing korg always gather make thing affordable well m come nowhere near price range competitor machine design guess company philosophy degree mean know time reason join korg provide ton accessibility people money really drive people make music bedroom gear use korg join company look schematic m example see philosophy actual circuit filter m think vcf us few number component ever would never kind thing normally filter use exclusively korg korg completely original filter saw saw circuit vca similar well us one transistor alter transconductance quite aggressive way use component time give distinctive sound also affordable manufacture well fine balance cost conscious well find sound identity deliver together still around new product make well time people say filter newer version m mini compare one sound different discussion get really emotional quickly guy sit different think sound different one different go back actual physic semiconductor never go get dope two different piece silicon always go difference think know embrace analog think beauty thing much freedom actually steer like woodcutter stonecarver rely engineer do fabricate degree building conductor semiconductor rely industrial piece create new industrial piece correct make custom chip expensive business synth business unfortunately usually big enough merit dish custom chip complete control everything usually end use component readily available control choice mainly component make small tolerance try use try make work intimidation factor folk first approach machine like see lot knob see empty socket see cable lie around guess unique opportunity get introduction different section also probably help u lose inhibition also guess lot general mechanism apply lot tone generate device maybe would great could give u physic lesson know gear analog synth fair maybe half ok let go kind half deep half entry let start entry level always spice noise think mention vco earlier vco section synth create raw waveform eventually work modulate create finer sound start point go pick saw wave look really noisy know pick something call saw wave shape like saw tooth think analog synths start saw wave internally process make square wave triangle wave demonstrate saw wave triangle square wave see really square get lance top actually artefact vc card cut low make slope essentially three sound usually come across vco guess hear get quite nice buzzy mellow round sound whereas square wave lot hollow triangle wave almost like sine wave get low amount harmonic need know harmonic overtone understand talk filter first basically get different harmonic content harmonic content note hz harmonic hz three time four time five time regular interval get peak depend waveform start next bit go talk vcf filter change harmonic content go put lowpass filter change cutoff brings high end spectrum demonstrates see immediately edge disappear turn cutoff round signal take away sharpness interest waveform actually look sharp sound sharp look round sound round warmer tone go go back harmonic content sawtooth get array harmonic pick one use filter resonance resonance actually emphasis certain frequency take resonance demonstrates emphasise certain part certain harmonic bring right fundamental almost hearing sine wave harmonic content bring octave high hear high octave add note octave high go slightly high fifth major third keep go get load dissonance high go harmonic content go dissonant go match musically fundamental turn change start waveform lot harmonic shave one want maybe add want work synthesizer basically maybe story go square wave go completely different harmonic content demonstrates fundamental get second harmonic go straight third one actually cut low square wave get harmonic sound completely different change start work filter create array different sound basically need know synthesizer story button um laugh mainly want modulate modulation layman term modulation change basically tweak knob back forth actually modulate cutoff frequency finger instead finger actually lfo low frequency oscillator manually lfo quite fast want kind thing demonstrates faster lfo speed lfo also work pitch yeah modulation much think actually need know want musician first place talk think important know end day want ear much important knowledge harmonic lie figure listen sound lot time work synths especially analog synths quite distinct strong character sometimes sit well mix part play time case switch waveform turn resonance bit work sound want experiment find way hard wire bit patch come particular synth fact patch want synthesis usually get synth want weird stuff like sample hold make really spacey sound maybe stuff little bit involve sample hold guess something people grow sampler invent always bit confuse sample hold basically way continuous signal play something hold stop signal regular interval sine wave sample hold become like staircase wave quite cool make spacey sound try common one common way plug pink noise sample hold clock lfo clock meaning meaning lfo determine point regularly signal held see maybe plug mr nishijima demonstrates instead put pitch put cutoff sound computer computer actually never make go turn sound cause go plug look start pink noise basically noise plug sample hold cutout sample hold look like make maybe bit faster basically pink noise screen stop regular interval voltage held still plug pitch cutoff demonstrates sound good guess get little deeper afterwards well cause stuff around ideally might around little bit folk want get really deep good chance also want touch briefly little machine really available lot world fly shelf volcas reason come well could go back monotron release humble entry analog market analog synth five knob really hard play conventional music sound twiddle noise make demonstrates kind synth noodle fun quite conceptual product threw market see people respond response people really like mess synths like analog synths care filter come whatever knew m filter really eye opening get positive reaction product kind spawn next product monotribe kind similar synthesis sequencer could actually make loop also drum machine mr nishijima make synth section could make something bit like music could make loop nishijima demonstrates note guess worth mention korg actually start drum machine company yeah first product make doncamatic donca onomatopoeia way sound tweak machine announce doncamatic founder korg voice think world first drum machine mpc anything sort sort drum machine use story behind company come fruition think mr nishijima inform korg found mr kato engineer mr osanai pass away mr osanai expert machine engineering also accordionist played accordion nightclub played need drummer hire one would cost lot headache thought maybe machine could replace drummer mr osanai korg founder expert machine engineering try invent machine play drum want human bad mood work well machine control easily want convenient player reason guy design machine look little bit like accordion well turn sideways well first rhythm machine doncamatic invent mr osanai introduce electronic sound use beginningreleased first synthesizer call korg exist old day original polyphonic model dozen connect korgplay connect monophonic synth use accordion origin synthesizer experiment back many mean accordion key yeah around like gesture size instrument synthesizer key control accordion one side story machine circuit korg drawn man still work korg name mr mieda electronic circuit engineer get involve project m fundamental circuit design m release several p series attach oscillator filter key key guess polyphonic synth exist already m release take one tone synth make monophonic one basis product old skill use filter circuit korg without change volca structure different m volca chord filter circuit korg fit well actually takahashi take filter experiment say stole laugh old day checked hand whether semiconductor fit filter need screen match characteristic semiconductor actually diode day cannot measure screen hand anymore diode use sell individual part nowadays taped together take one one measure screen impossible solder substrate experiment get sound use without screen procedure point takahashi notice sound great happen use filter volca yeah filter monotribe derive m fantastic sound monophonic synths work volcas three vcos three vcos need filter work harmony smoothly wander office filter project mind mr nishijima work call diode ladder filter inherently quite difficult circuit manufacture stable experiment make possible perfect timing look filter one sound great could put production come together volcas also machine house call mono poly mention monophonic polyphonic quite bit could briefly explain people care particular machine fun mono poly mono poly design senior worker four vcos oscillator vco change pitch individually mono poly one filter one vca make four sound time call mono poly four sound poly though make name mix mono poly designer intend make monophonic synthesizer four vcos mono poly use ic use sequential circuit prophet product ssm curtis sound familiar u easily accessible user mono poly well recommend point cross modulation mix oscillator make complicate sound close fm mono poly control flexibly actually completely analog model could model model mono poly sound people care go back monophonic polyphonic thing think word paraphonic mono poly four vcos play separate note go filter vca modulate paraphonic rather polyphonic well actually demonstrates play three different note go circuit mix mono poly also available software function use perfectly pc could briefly explain four little machine design open question ok well since talk synths start two synths one monophonic synth play one note sound really good speaker like say get diode bridge filter get sequencer one vco demonstrates two vcos third one synth bass bascially much take hint certain bass machine um laugh need call lawyer spell see laugh lot guess cross inspiration different manufacturer everyone follow everyone else exactly look three come time really important people get message few knob big chunkier knob look like go make bass sound polyphonic synth play demonstrates synth quite complicate thing synth lot knob lot parameter work motion sequencer parameter create loop want look like different would kraftwerk die roboter sound instead stylophone one different would kind similar interface right interface similar sound quite different think particular image thought something little bit different way cost factor determine aesthetic guess look like conscious decision make affordable possible yes start plan new product start thing like much go cost size speaker many knob close actually make happen start like ok go use knob go flash separate display show go also use case use mold three product cost always important part development actually think quite liberate work cost constraint like say analog circuit always problem need find solution way find something else quite excite work low cost product need find workarounds avoid use really expensive component discover thing money world end becomes affordable get lot people enjoy everyone winner drum section synth drum machine demonstrates something clip kick drum bascially pulse go resonator raw kick soundanalog drum era basically base lot sound time new one new one funny one actually analog manipulate sample actually really destroy sample start play sample maybe change pitch slice make glitchy whatever automate turn automation demonstrates kind thing change start point end point sample pitch stuff around gesture volca machine around decade think whole point volcas revisit different format example anything new newness everything knob automate completely change game try borrow past put different context different cultural set different type box different price set make something completely new something say fit hand luggage lose bag sometimes happens people play night need worry pay rent rest year get insurance guess question mic wonder extent interact musician make design question occur talk human machine interaction musician machine interaction depends product usually musician thing come quite late especially talk idea word actually know product go feel like dangerous point involve lot different kind people get prototype work quite sure good point start go round musician ask opinion always difficult balance quite flat various people view whether product good yeah try involve early possible u get prototype ready thought interest say work cost constraint something like also wonder would money object constraint really liberate money world make new product honest would idea would know mr nishijima would told whatever want matter much cost would go work forever maybe would never get new product engineer try whatever want one would see end product would available try hard make product well manufacturer cost constraint work weigh cost make customer unable buy product keep balance difficult thing develop product spent lot money make product could make good one engineer self satisfaction musician like quality product would never sellable market think need kind cost constraint time city probably high density ferrari dealer planet seem market different type cost constraint artisan craftsmanship artisan synth builder well yeah think think get really bore load money think fun people interact product say good think sale figure think important feel want put product worthless get deliver connect think probably build synths money world would able everything nothing hello mention briefly circuit bending kid could actually get modify thing wonder anecdote one discovery make chance try thing daily basis rare event think happens lot lot thing happen chance go quote dave smith quote bob moog talk say bob moog know circuit sound good happens really feel design circuit meant sound certain way image would sound work cad draw circuit test prototype lucky work really lucky sound way intend time sound different sometimes sound different good way sometimes sound different bad way term accidental discovery get time incremental think think ever short circuit mistake discover new way synthesis never big mr nishijima know experienced something accident well make sound need build substrate call pcv case design wrong unexpected sound come try check go discover something accident obviously intend design usually engineer never design like something like happens design one especially since would tend follow stereotype engineer decade experienced unexpected example patch patch wrong like person know electricity get astonish sound still kind discovery today people feel way guess mystery sound still unknown even u engineer world sound quite interest nishijima san takahashi san thank join u explore wonder sound put thank much
