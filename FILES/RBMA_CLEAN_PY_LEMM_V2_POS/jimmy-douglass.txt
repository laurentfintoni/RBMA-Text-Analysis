native instrument reverb dc native reverb know ok really hear tell music friend go like new dc native reverb oh native good plug chug like percent processing computer time tell look purpose reverb know give space make spatial spacious whatever like well shitty reverb take percent talk difference analog flanger warmer really get time suppose like aesthetic understandable effect know say extent really important use best sound technology time purpose serf like give detail actually whole idea song get rack kind shit lately use lot plugins still get great vintage gear know collect really nice also get alesis qudraverb know old quadraverb old little shitty box use time especially want chorus box something way crappy sound bittage low bittage like low resolution kind maybe act tape head know digital know maybe think resolution want hand get vocalist want heard clearly use vocal make sound kind muffle dull perhaps every one particular purpose depend think say say would always case would case really want good reverb like say use power print take plugin take care problem yeah produce donny hathway anything like track talk simple stuff yeah sometimes need know extent agree depends try right absolutely take existentialist stance defend vintage sometimes need also another question think possible digital technology digital produce long least require quality sound work enough get point good think always cheaper hard question thing listen record listen sell sell thing people damn sell record say anymore mean one thing really happen listen go like rule know always always work way always say rule whenever somebody walk door tell get happen go problem maybe want happen maybe see way maybe deliver today maybe deliver want maybe want really right like open mind let see journey
