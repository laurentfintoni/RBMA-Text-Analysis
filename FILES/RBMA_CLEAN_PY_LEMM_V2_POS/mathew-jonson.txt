particular probably mix bunch time another bassline come stuff come idea track want start synthy synthesizer heard begin sh basically arpeggio go around decide hit certain note people might know term arpeggio might know arpeggio basically hold chord keyboard cycle chord either may octave hit three note chord might octave whatever way sh work pretty much synthesizer studio work run oldschool way din sync trigger particular bassline note revolve around rhythm note sent rimshot tr tell play note really midi bit different reason sound like change lot guy know synthesis stuff basically envelope synthesizer everything hold decay nice sh decay slider right drop certain note basically hit go mimic jamming slider dhhh dh dhh dhh hit note note note fly around want offbeat stuff put little filler whatever hit note delay make fill anyway basically synthesizer lot play bunch chord revolve bar loop go round drop trigger want long amount trigger sent multiple amount note play one synthesizer go revolve loop five trigger five note always go loop around want four bar phrase change end still use five trigger might different place bar instead play five note go around could play five note like note instead five maybe change couple something kind basic way work kind nice put boundary use computer write drum bass love computer possibility endless really whatever want also nice work lot oldschool gear like accept fact move add another part give people idea studio look like man studio basically front channel allen heath gl nice mix board right hand side one sh beside elektron machinedrum sh tb beside thing call siel italian synthesizer kinda weird cool shelf purposely touch everything mix able grab everything go want able change something actually hand whenever want jxp except get programmer jxp wire sit beside mixer want change parameter synthesizer right mixer tr gesture hand indicate position put computer record side gesture left hand band compressor effect top effect underneath knob stuff change want well left tr tr beside panel go rack side gesture left nord lead rack sit effect get ensoniq dp go underneath couple a korg multi effect processor doepfer something like three band analog sequencer knob one assign knob pitch gate trigger whatever parameter want control frequency cut synthesizer get system m modular synthesizer midi controller underneath adjust synthesizer another jxp gesture left another sh beside system another dp plus eventide dsp another a kind within arm reach nice able write track whatever think time like go along need turn feedback delay wash turn breakdown right front music particular minimal techno stuff lot music played really really really amaze pa sound incredible really get get every little pop crackle hiss perfect term monitor look funny disagree know little pop monitor pair monitor like find dj set like club set watt sub woofer underneath nice pair sennheiser headphone kind monitor really monitor headphone suck never go get proper bass response pair headphone reason use kind monitor music get played nightclub want listen minute long song home thing listen techno home listen public enemy n w shit whatever club though listen big room like stretch arm indicate size academy lecture room echo reverb go sit home nice pair monitor genelecs something like really pick little pop little tick click speaker feel behind find well like jackin loud also like lot low end always mix sub want full range frequency also find mixed pair genelecs something like good speaker responsive actually get rhythm stuff like think cool little rhythm create really minuscule thing exact speaker tune put club bunch reverb sudden anymore echoed hearing bassline chord drum really good room nightclub maybe big outdoor festival nice funktion one soundsystem something really nice yeah hear lot stuff great hopefully mix good enough mix crappy pair speaker like nsinstance reason thing standard mix sound like shit sound like car radio make something sound good pair thing go sound good anywhere brother make many track awesome mix actually ten time well mix heard master boomy bottom low cut put yet compression sort stuff master help bring little fine point something master engineer really need worry much mix track ghettoblaster sony ghettoblaster driver big mixed track track track thing always like nathan get shit together spending money gear mix ghettoblaster take mix ghettoblaster big club full range sound mix sound way tighter mine mix pair crappy speaker need expensive monitor stuff go buy pair adam monitor nice nice pair monitor like movie soundtrack want get far nightclub really necessary drop amount money really nice speaker sometimes ridiculous much rather put gear effect processor compressor stuff like often play mathew jonson play live travel around world give u lowdown studio look like gearwise lot stuff fit plane scale take live thing man play live use ableton live g bring motu mkii soundcard run ten out promoter rent either gl midas venice low end high end mid range nicer mixer rent one importantly ask play live mixer channel least six auxiliary sends mid sweep plus hopefully three band two mid sweep eq actually tune sound club go sound half good ask ensoniq dp basically effect processor run four different effect time combination whatever run reverb one channel delay another maybe phaser chorus something like might change little normally leave time delay time reverb stuff need club pretty much leave obviously year collaborate well people collaboration work enjoy collaborate enjoy collaborate hard collaborate people music personal thing people everybody completely different method way write music really hard really lucky work people band work well together get sort argument studio happen band gemini way time stuff happens studio ridiculous get point one u storm studio piss leave work people learn system work instance way work band two u studio time one person three u many head studio try anything creative always one person kind anything get bore whatever maybe start think something else get one person time two people also collaborate people especially electronic music sense especially use sampler stuff like amount hour tedious work use stuff take lot time people sampler time annoy thing could possibly deal sit want make music get wait two hour friend level every single sample work processing sample make work one guy band paddy use sampler always one probably time hour studio prepare live pa write track chooses use sampler great love come lot work patience synthesizer play stuff really easy dan rhodes player vocoder player want play even faster train keyboard player drop wait time studio put tv top organ watch television work stuff would keep mind focus piss u get bore whatever go ask approach remixing believe brought remix shall listen yeah remix moby new album hotel track remixed call slip away track almost like slow contemporary rock ballad really thing much basically take vocal chopped lot put harmonic pitch basically drop vocal fifth know guy familiar moby music big epic string put take string line chopped make creepy evil sound like like remixes end use much person part usually turn write track electronic music also like remixing much master either keep mind music moby slip away focus people slip remix mathew jonson applause say played actually like remixes like remixes fun depend sometimes fun come close get right never know go happen write music sometimes something really good come sometimes like one give remix even walk studio two day due get head around listen track hold people slip away personally really push button actually make mad listen time respect moby music particular track really hard think use part like go decide think long time actually take part take computer studio played studio make mad make freak put headphone sat couch work work basically get something chopped vocal basically make say focus people say focus people slip kind like fuck seem like little bit well say hang people sound creepy anyway know laugh shake head consider method apply production probably pretty hard question answer one particular track listen back really proud remix track make yeah yeah try download return zombie bikers right hopefully download time track call return zombie bikers return zombie bikers label yep like one like decompression like typerope one think musically best call freedom engine itiswhatitis number five really weird story show mistake chaos stuff come music make really good kind let go basically make track friend sit around studio couch hang jokingly programmed something completely random musical influence maybe note chose knew kind similar key together know play lot black note totally cheat say black note black note keyboard play black note almost always sound good laugh lot way combination white key stuff pretty easy make minor chord augment minor chord play lot black note like explain way sh work program note completely randomly anyway count th trigger put hold transpose hand hold right hand plug bunch note press play get loop loop know sings da na na na da na na held transpose button keyboard kept held start like ok sound kind cool try experiment something completely random even sound like arpeggio play like make sound like ok note work transpose start something different start play mary little lamb basic thing hearing note transpose arpeggio whatever key kid song play actually come song get awesome bassline actually sound like something sat write computer note note notation like whoa really really complicate actually come complete random note basically transpose different time something work something work certain transpose try another note transpose eventually time song bar loop transpose key kind work right way mixed track actually train hold transpose button little finger play transpose note something like sings daaa da na na na actually really hard hearing something really like completely different bassline train whole track way rhythmic anything natural feel make something sound like intuitive awesome big deep track sound personal actually one track actually make cry make master session listen really hit chord weird experiment work whole time hand mimic play mix board write like one chord kind swell lfo kind come basically mixed mute fader change make development hand cool experiment kind weird thing never really know go happen like let chaos come like come lot stuff try hold onto really technical stuff lot theoretical knowledge music theory studio engineering theory try let affect much get really heavy think stuff take away soul music important feel nerd go like mimic tweak hand hour hour take away soul music mention feel listen late production richie hawtin actually richie hawtin totally technical part soul anymore feel different everybody heard people say richie new stuff also heard people say really super deep really get talk plastikman stuff closer ep stuff listen sound though another world personally kind relate would disagree soul definitely sound human laugh also really know work interest listen new production new experience obvious actually talk get film industry maybe also tell important improvisation stuff heard story help richie regard mix technique know richie hawtin experiment mix technique digital audio material ableton live personally never actually watch richie mix one track studio probably like never let anybody usually tell something interest technology stuff start new label go bring people like go go go bring ricardo villalobos people friend go go release dvd kinda cool even keep right track take track go release label mix somewhere else record whatever go go release dvd go come studio mix surround stereo get two amek board either side desk capable take track separate personally go go write something new write well like yeah go label go cool one else moment sure would say one big production lesson learn last year big piece advice could give people laugh ah know best would anything maybe last four five year figure sudden maybe something really obvious change whole way music sound far last couple year lot little thing think big thing career far make music learn keep add thing top try back away like even new track write lot part need strip bit want cloud frequency range right want certain thing like hank shocklee talk yesterday certain thing hold certain frequency range want take away part bassline want stick another bassline right top necessarily young make something like oh cool add key part another key part another harmonic part keep add best thing could say unless something sound like every single part write track add something sit listen feel like ok add energy music make engage point get sharper muddy thing make part part even note note ask add take away energy music want notice trust way feel like personally find write music get physical feel tell part want use track might even bunch part already go maybe even slightest little change volume one like bassline anything sudden make everything come together track actually get feel though big energy ball right around whole body feel almost like roll get feel fall like stand edge cliff lean actually fall feel uneasiness like go fall kind feeling know guy feel write music stuff huge physical feel happens start trust intuition part put put something even feel like whoa write really complicate key part put top even though may something theoretically might best thing ever write complicate chord wise progression wise whatever really hold like want throw sometimes add track technology nice something really crazy maybe record chuck live set maybe write something around something like guess hold thing least bit unsure part matter work three day certain part work hold chuck every time thrown something garbage matter matter cool anything throw thing away right behind idea chain something go work work throw garbage go sooner later go find something add certain energy certain feel music another area incredible experience last year lot people room already release music many go release music obviously start get area contract publishing talk little bit contract experience kind thing fair deal far release record yeah
