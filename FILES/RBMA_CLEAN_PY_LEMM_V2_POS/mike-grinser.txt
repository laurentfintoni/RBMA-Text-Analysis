listen electronic music last decade probably heard work person sit next couch even might never heard name master engineer work two renowned master studio berlin dubplates master manmade master partner tim xavier please join welcome mike grinser applause welcome thank come go get master lot today lot people audience people interested audio general sort black box lot visual aid go project bit go process granulary possible think important know first get music general decide become master engineer especially introduction electronic music introduction electronic music endpretty much rock guy grunge music nirvana band like point first heard electronic music chicago guess band like phuture example quite impressed sound music want know new sound music do like start point electronic music endbeginningtime expose phuture first place still living countryside grow small village south germany bavaria still living countryside yeah go club friend mine run club hang dj happen basically quickly go hearing phuture dj dj like yeah towards endlike kind crossover sound would go hip hop stuff rock stuff electronic stuff quite huge variety mixture different style music certain point start get music much technical level oppose purely musical one yeah always quite technically interested start produce music get interested produce electronic music release first record test cut dubplate play dj always try go studio go master studio sit session point get interested mainly music come wax time produce music still living hometown still living hometown left quite shortly like beginninglanded munich study university get access quite famous clubcalled ultraschall one owner club also record label accident get know idea produce release music found home record label call disko b people might familiar talk little bit sound ultraschall associate time sound ultraschall associate mainly techno lot international dj book club like dj detroit lot american guy also people austria club relationship u like underground resistance detroit people chicago people also continental europe vienna example patrick pulsinger guy mention lot name label feel sound record come time musical level technical level already think way improve guess yeah guess sound especially electronic dance music time decade nowadays pretty much changedlike pretty rough studio much processing gear maybe also much know come vinyl cut think simply knowledge available accessible way people interested way accessible lot people work master industry lot knowledge self taught easy especially come vinyl access knowledge go study thing need find people mentor show thing think backlot people transfer music disc lot knowledge self taught adapt mentor mentor mentorsproducing music first one also accident tobias neumann happen studio studio give u vocal booth small production studio get first mixdowns show couple trick skill later start master career nowadays partner tim xavier show cut system work show transfer music time brought tim american guy point move studio brooklyn berlin own american cut system scully westrex cut system first learn system later met christoph grote beverborg dubplates master owner dubplates master later show cut neumann vms system know look photo brought go get bit later difference neumann scully describe think talk master far answer basic question master someone regular consumer music care master basic speak master bridge production duplication bridge production record mix studio world music get release get master may get transfer one medium another medium master medium master studio speed electro disc vinyl manufacturing data set let say cd production get sent press plant press plant replicates master duplicate second part question someone worry master master also last technical also last creative step music production master make sure music translates well different listen environment different playback medium well master translate also help sale guess good sound product end curious would answer give first start master engineer approach differently year first start work tim xavier first sort get foot wet sort acquire knowledge yeah begin get basically start digital master everything else come later think first gain knowledge get feel possible possible like master work left right stereo sound access individual instrument record work stereo sound apply processing full mixdown little thing go long away adjust something frequency domain one part influence totally different part every engineer find path way gain knowledge approach music apply processing talk lesson though first start think master describe sort thing balance formal education maybe learn someone directly informal actually sit behind lathe processing chain master something learn job yeah think well think important educate ear technical manner also artistic way need learn lesson think gain intuition start work project get collection recording sometimes recording make one studio one band one producer land master studio also collection different thing like compilation example need get feel start land end mention balance technical artistic artistic master think important work music treat music people respect musicality music also emotion music get feel would band producer mean record want go record mixdown do well lack different aspect producer able fulfill idea production arrangement mixdown need help objective ear master engineer master engineer get music hear first time allows lend producer musician objective ear apply processing accordingly find balance benefit sacrifice would say every processing step necessarily benefit first sacrifice add processing add little bit noise every processing step do right order achieve good result much people send record master much want master process change last decade since first start factor contribute someone ask something completely different record possibly exact genre music versus record something similar yes think nowadays come record example lot people expect record sound like cd mean record sound like cd yeah less artifact possible come vinyl thing quality playback outside inside change pretty much distance shrink towards inside make difficult playback system cartridge read information regard electronic music example energy distribute throughout frequency range range hearing like hertz kilohertz change pretty much recordsmuch information like hz nowadays bass drum rather around hz reason like shift like specifically think lot back day want record record need book studio probably daily basis could get easily quite expensive new technical possibility record computer different daw pretty much democratic influence music produce music mixed nowadays easily accessible everyone get computer get daw get couple plug in produce music back day much difficult lot band musician need big record label could afford book studio consumer expectation also impact work ask yeah producer want yeah someone listen hard say musician producer expect apply little bit enhance music transfer processing others expect change sound transform sound deep processing master engineer get feel necessary project record hand actual consumer say someone last year listen change cd stream vinyl back stream different avenue particularly come something relatively new lot people like stream affect artist want master compete sort field know whether artist think much think profession also train people nowadays often deliver different set master different platform music get release nowadays often release different medium let say vinyl cd digital medium also digital medium quite big difference online distribute music file mp wave aiff people download stream service nowadays quite difficult spread information people release music distributor distributor different aggregate place music different stream platform download shop spread information master platform get lose get quite difficult think u engineer train people spread knowledge best medium term best particular thing see people constantly misinterpret think case something like loudness yes yes problem still lot people ask loud file think someone search music online record shop argument buy file buy record sound louder stuff certain degree true always exist already exist backmusic played radio suddenly song played radio sound louder song always argument listener consumer buy year ago reach quite crazy amount loudness people still ask quite high loudness also u train people tell always good idea excessive loudness implies problem playback club sound system example amplifier speaker cabinet start distort start overdrive also music played radio music stream online almost stream platform loudness correction algorithm built mean exactly algorithm measure loudness song accessible match certain loudness influence sound also frequency pattern record master loud music stream algorithm measure change loudness also frequency content sacrifice dynamic range master step reach point go enforce stream service anyway yes yes thing stream platform loudness minus loudness unit different measurement compare peak rms music distribute online people buy file loudness much much high find good idea either see whether client willing step back loudness may consider two different set master frequently find client actually amenable objective recommendation make would say client open ear ask name name good think master engineer also style kind yeah mean always print mike grinser print master like little bit louder others like little bit low want little bit low end high end master different time producer artist musician pick master studio master engineer example go online discogs look engineer master cut record release quite good resource people find preference engineer work could also come attend session would always recommend get inside happens studio happens master also get feel work like personal connection always good idea come release music master music go back little bit talk individual master engineer sort signature people first start master first start get interested study record without actually access backreleasing music pretty much knew want go always music collector listen lot different kind different style music idea want go want work maybe also try different thing one place one release find perfect match although master also quite expensive depend studio difficult people actually reach level first get someone sign release believe something want sign put money master get multiple people willing give shot different studio right yeah yeah yeah mean master take time take studio time studio built philosophy studio work people music want best want end result sound good possible mean need build processing chain need think acoustic monitoring run studio cost money ask artist client pay master sure go get paid yeah hand also take part money reinvest studio make thing well improve thing big mistake see people send file master know would send would really frustrate different thing first find important leave little bit head room record music u master engineer work tell daw measure dbfs meaning db full scale digital full scale would recommend leave little bit head room would around three like dbfs decibel relative full scale peak head room also work sample rate least sample rate final medium case cd would khz could also work high good idea example use double sample rate final product case cd could use example film music music video k hz could use way round issue want go sample rate like k k would lot uneven number conversion good converter round round number always round artifact problem music center rhythm important rhythm instrument phase reverse rhythmical instrument percussion bass drum snare drum correct regard polarity become issue signal right polarity positive waveform follow negative waveform positive waveform thing connect right way proper way positive waveform would cause speaker cone move outside negative part waveform let cone move inside influence punch impact example regard frequency range also good idea individual instrument record dynamically control good way several instrument play time influence one instrument modulate mask instrument control different part frequency domain right way dynamically less mask modulation artifact sometimes especially come vinyl good idea high end control possible cut problem come excessive high end sibilance high hit crash phoneme vocal thing sibilance phoneme vocal strong sawtooth waveform sawtooth waveform complex get complex problem playback cut system always superior compare playback system call vinyl distortion distortion come cut process playback another thing watch control low end get muddy instrument low end like bassline bass drum low tom conga stuff like separate well low end get muddy yeah think lot keep track yes well let say get something hit right point problem described think would good opportunity segue actually processing chain start master particular track know brought example maybe could bring talk processing chain manmade master studio let assume nothing problem whatever track come show screen right show grinser brings photograph overhead screen go maybe talk bit people see see part processing chain manmade master design processing chain try keep versatile collection instrument processor allow access different part frequency domain basically mixture hybrid mixture digital piece gear plugins white piece bottom two digital processor one seven band digital minimum phase eq one compressor limiter de esser digitally first piece expand seven band repeat yeah seven band minimum phase equalizer mainly use clean spectrum try describe instrument modulate mask signal get record record room room resonance example get record use eq band find modulation artifact resonance dip narrow band parametric filter processing chain say digital part analog part digital router analog router thing connect together quite freely decide processing chain piece gear use piece gear leave processing chain important listen environment listen environment come master find important say first time listen record spend time new master take much time compare record mixdown example manmade studio know plan half hour work one track sometimes minute minute sometimes also minute around half hour give opportunity take right decision good listen environment good acoustic good monitoring system help take right decision come tonal balance important master balance let say listen environment lack low end frequency low end may cancel others add due room resonance make hard take decision need low end need less low end much low end master always sound quieter compare well balance master would imply problem therefore good listen environment well treat room well set speaker system would help master would benefit take u element processing chain yeah middle see screen right see one monitor thing meter system opportunity meter frequency spectrum also left right relationship correlation meter coulometer yeah monitor frequency balance also stereo image bottom picture right see monitor controller monitor controller find important master studio basically monitoring part mix desk source turntable feedback information cut system output daw analog output digital output connect switch knob compare thing b compare record digital master example source monitor controller choose level offset proper b comparison kind art form compare master pre master example important loudness match exactly ear pretty sensitive regard level even untrained ear half db level difference would think louder one well even would play two time mixdown one half db louder would clearly point one half db louder say well although difference level difference yeah monitor controller mix combine daw make easy b comparison wherever processing chain compare different medium else happens actually start cut record time nowadays pretty good bandwidth internet example call master approval someone come session sends project internet master project would master file end artist attends session would prefer send home master familiar listen environment first time maybe spent studio probably impressed studio listen environment monitoring system gear find find good idea artist possibility take master home check listen environment car stereo studio dj play give notice whether good master artist enjoys master second step would prepare transfer session transfer master one medium mostly daw nowadays lacquer disc example acetate vinyl manufacturing bring image lathe use cut mention little bit earlier learn scully lathe yes guess neumann yes might good talk difference learn curve might different one maybe even make full screen people go flip still manmade master actually go cut digital file yeah call cut system cut lathe cut desk cut system lot electronic component fine mechanic component see platter small thing actual heart machine cutter flip different picture see well see platter inch master cut left black thing microscope order operator engineer able check groove microscope different thing example decide cut depth depth groove check whether cut stylus still good quality long stylus last stylus depends nowadays often problem supply vinyl acetate lacquer stylus quality varies neumann spec cut hour much cut stylus either ruby sapphire shape round time stylus also break let say roughly around cut hour also decide quality stylus visually look microscope also listen blank groove cut blank groove groove without modulation groove without music listen decide noise floor lacquer cut artifact vinyl crack artifact pop tick stylus good thing hear little bit white noise due playback stylus travel inside groove cause white noise artifact vinyl add different processing press plant right see instrument measure pressure delicate part cut system cutter head piece cutter head translates incoming electrical signal modulational vibration let say send pure sine tone cut system thousand cycle mean thousand hz one khz cut stylus would vibrate thousand time left right mono signal cutter head quite strong electromagnet coil form coil form start vibrate accord electrical incoming signal magnetic field coil form connect cut stylus cut stylus see cutter bottom flip see cut stylus mount also see two wire order least amount noise introduce record groove cut stylus heat similar would cut knife butter use hot knife warm knife flank cut much precise compare cold knife similar pressure meter show cutter head close system depend amount high frequency signal get quite warm hot inside cutter heat system close heat cannot go somewhere use helium cool coil form give longer life see close cutter cut stylus stylus cut groove surface lacquer aluminum plate aluminum plate coat nitrate cellulose lacquer groove cut lacquer surface cut stylus cut groove material cut order modulation sacrifice cutout material cut system vacuum system suck chip call chip basically string lacquer low pressure suck chip travel small pipe go wrong stage thing actually cut groove lacquer lacquer go sent press plant sort want see groove mention microscope actually look cut want see groove sign might irregular actually cause problem press plant yeah want see clean groove couple picture groove groove see take picture mobile phone ocular microscope see couple groove modulate groove one groove three maybe four white line two white line outside groove flank blurry line middle bottom groove part bottom groove groove flank need microscope microscope light groove highlight see ocular want see clean white blurry line also check microscope make sure cut happens groove modulate cut system cut spiral towards inside groove modulate need part cut system drive cutter head cut spiral without groove ever touch collide groove touch collide collide skip playback touch cause problem processing press plant high amount noise see four groove big excursion low end information tiny detailed thing inside groove mid high frequency stereo information cut stereo signal one groove work one groove two signal groove two groove flank groove flank carry one signal one flank left signal flank right signal stereo information timing difference left right phase difference left right system built call call system mean coil form angle degree surface record timing difference phase offset left right horizontal lateral information call also vertical information show groove high electron microscope see detail groove see groove get quite complex depend frequency phase content cut stylus kind movement left right listen record get final version something master record get pleasure process give highly technical keep interested master something might seem esoteric talk groove depth variation groove describe even maintenance cutter head thing like keep excite something spend really significant amount time personally begin saw first timealways find like piece art miracle cut music take plate put turntable listen without buying record something like piece art always like wow crazy bring something actually cut separate something press like cut dubplate want use example listen yeah brought couple record press record also cut couple snippet dubplate dubplate lacquer disc difference diameter size different cut use inch lacquer brought dubplates go demonstrate dubplate exactly like demonstrate playback issue outside inside say distance one groove one rotation outside inside change change one rotation rpm always second matter whether finger outside inside distance shrink towards inside make much harder playback cartridge track information especially high frequency information detailed part groove show also mean really maximum cut onto record still high fidelity possible depends pretty much record home might notice record different loudness may find record quieter another record record much louder compare lp record example play snippet play example vinyl snippet inside sound like play example vinyl different part song second snippet information high frequency play example vinyl outside listen inside play example vinyl think even listen environment perfect b listen test hear quite clear difference high frequency content outside inside one want release music record couple thing keep mind like several track one side record good idea place track high amount high frequency content towards outside dull track towards inside example high time vinyl lpsslike track place make sense regard medium mean ballad song less high frequency content sparse arrangement place inside energetic track track high amount high frequency place outside come record also good idea keep play time mind say loudness record mainly mainly related time per side mean shorter play time one side louder record cut take electronic music know two different rotation speed rpm rpm rpm play time without lose level like nine minute rpm bit longer record spin slow around minute everything exceed play time need reduce level let say want make record played dj make much sense put minute side record level loudness would quite low make hard dj mix set record dj would play would definitely much louder quiet record make hard dj play release lp album like hi fi listen home listen find practical play time minute minute maximum minute opinion really make sense know brought couple record thing work maybe listen one two think interest talk like know record brought particular challenge go relative people think either master something general relates individual element hard speak change record time hold quite interest project time ago nowadays last year quite release project label people beautiful issue sure quite lot sometimes master medium available record record love life orchestra peter gordon peter gordon part arthur russell bandmaster master tape master file record found good new old stock copy discogs record record track digital label sent recording another studio good processing gear work spectrum record reduce vinyl artifact reduce crackle reduce pop tick file get sent back master music cut play let hear sound record also digital master love life orchestra love life orchestra song call condo record music love life orchestra condo digital master comparison yeah digital source vinyl pretty much depends music vinyl nice medium vinyl physical limitation cut vinyl playback sound vinyl close way hear certain music example experimental music music square wave form aggressive music vinyl might best medium physically quite limited yeah regard frequency content regard phase relationship left right channel yeah good keep mind even vinyl release name necessarily mean best possible format music come yes yes well think probably still barely scratch surface still yeah wannathank come today share knowledge master think probably illuminate people audience much thank mike applause thank thank hope chance show different task master little bit insight happens kind black box master studio applause thank come question audience see hand already microphone come keep hit one one gonna hit stop hi would like ask two question think realistically difference analog digital master nowadays also people cannot buy hardware digital master software plug in would recommend achieve professional sound difference let say part master nowadays do purely digital example limit nowadays purely digital task difference nowadays algorithm computer processing power good achieve good result digital processing difference workflow analog output piece also digital output piece help concentrate music work less screen parameter number stuff like yeah second part question good good software master limiter also eq recently one picture show white digital piece gear swiss company call wei compressor call wei d recently plug release emulation code get port plug sonically transparent interest cool thank much want ask first like every month every week new isotope plug in vsts whatever come try take job say embrace opportunity bedroom producer budget huge master challenge well second part question think artificial intelligence might get way master next year think new produce produce want play music dj example could use automate processing different option could use idea happens think music quite personal yeah art personal emotion think artificial intelligence really help basic concept music thank hi thank information give u really insightful question regard technical say train ear technical also preference taste line draw accord taste instance receive production master feel like sound get inspire draw line taste basically technically line two basically go studio leave taste door work project sound sometimes might issue would go back producer ask improve thing time really tell whether taste sometimes happens work something take home think wow somehow like listen home sound completely different different way hearing different approach thing master need technically train ear think listen training golden ear example thing gain intuition work recording think job regular basis much taste sure work project know person quite important job everyday happen pretty fast come automatic thing instead listen music find path deal thing like think time progress time taste master try help try take people give make thing little well taste thank second part question electronic music mostly mean kind music certain trend sometimes evolve year maybe still go feel sometimes go impact work kind trend popular like minimal techno berlin kind stuff micro house france impact work behind desk master try think genre sure sometimes genre project work influence way work genre implies music played played club played home stereo intimate aggressive yeah thank hope answer question question couple hello usually follow specific process work example start equalization multi band compression limit depend track need yeah pretty much depends project track need recording need processing others need less processing say first second last last step pretty clear last step somehow limiter brickwall limiter everything happens depends record rule master work depends recording need concept technical thing artistic part technical aspect correct thing narrow band filter example de noise also part master come everything else record dc offset would correct first continue artistic part call audio sweeten correction ok kind audio sweetener use like use master processing use mainly two thing equalization compression two basic thing combination limit expansion depend project ok artist sends track usually give feedback start master tell need fix mix usual concept usually encounter problem like serious problem find important correct let say example instrument important instrument let say snare drum example snare drum completely phase would mean played back mono snare drum would miss example ask electronic music lot club soundsystems mono even like berghain soundsystem example weekend far know mono impact would sad artist miss snare drum would go back tell hey phase may wannacorrect gonna bpm really like well like think one would like know weight vinyl sometimes gram vinyl effect music press vinyl make difference thick vinyl mean sound quality yeah myth gram gram make difference sound difference handle record feel marketing yeah yeah ok make difference press plant ask virgin vinyl often press plant vinyl mixture recycle virgin vinyl make difference regard noise example anyone else ok one hello hi insightful question master usually people concentrate low end high end usually mid range get bit forgotten work mid range usually go low end high end mid range work mid range apart depends yeah club music nowadays look frequency content analyzer look little bit like bathtub huge low end much mids high end sound information mid frequency important ear evolution much sensitive hear linear ear pretty sensitive frequency domain ear much less sensitive low high frequency track huge low end little bit high end information mids always sound low compare track information mids frequency content frequency balance track quite far would either talk artist would try apply processing obvious eqing example could sometimes mix parallel path frequency selective parallel path let say information mids strong enough want strong without obvious eq step quite high amount gain prefer example mix parallel path try raise level mids one question type eq approach recently dynamic eq use lot right think add dynamic usual process work dynamic eq basically similar multi band compression want use prepared processor quite complicate different band band gain second knob quality q factor dynamic function threshold attack release get quite complicate apply processing least always try keep thing control control sit master like something master detail sound make easy well outcome know go change order get rid artifact like complicate processing like multi band compression dynamic eqing quite steep learn curve yeah thank let give mike another round applause thank come applause
