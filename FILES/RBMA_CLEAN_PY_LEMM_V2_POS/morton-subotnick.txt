send u money sent u cheque put wall never use pool equipment reason tell meeting stockhausen circumstance met number time remember first time go festival stockhausen another guy like remember oh god stockhausen guy someone guy early electronic music world look none nobody look struggle get start synthesizer even time thought studio pretty stupid idea cut tape one thing stockhausen say first met tour united state give lecture give lecture say electronic music need musician anymore remember say come go c sings scale take tape measure sings measure lay go sings go sings make diagonal cut four inch across tape say tell gonna replace musician nobody look point nothing hard imagine nothing great make thing nothing point conceive idea want sort machine become buchla idea want able get point timetable tv screen timetable period talk look see transistor tape recorder credit card come time right time talk begin pool equipment endrealized pool equipment probably met stockhausen anybody else think talk late completely aware many people large number people enough world change radically electronics gonna cheap clear move moment time history equivalent music printing press word startle thought god time alive age could stayed musician problem pretty well write music instrument music begin played spite people booed aspen knew nothing electronics tape recorder experiment knew nothing electronics knew enough know happen thought go try make piece feel aptitude technology go throw clarinet away finally write music instrument anymore dedicate point history pivotal point think could write great music could part change like begin printing press part would like person say need wannaforth really felt important thing opportunity part credit card come thank reason go become important moment time play music learn read music take music lesson money upper class stratify thing time aristotle least point talk record music fine art music elite reason economics afford time money train kid music italy different train orphan music time renaissance world part aristocratic thing printing press thing happen word part church part authority printing press come everybody could read start many religion many idea demography idea go happen music happen cheap transistor cheap credit card meant even need money cheap clear everybody world would iphone laugh something reason credit card become important tip go change people knew electronics hewlett packard oscillator cost equivalent probably one oscillator nothing go make oscillate noise even afford happen give hewlett packard oscillator buy suddenly gonna change reason imagine ableton would cost back certain point call engineer interviewed idea want build something know exactly build talk period make piece perform san francisco two dejour tape recorder could get sound around room two two track tape recorder four musician light flat person spoke big multimedia piece minute long unlike performance three four year aspen audience go crazy critic say new artform born perform three time three week people call want tour thing amaze put away tour decide yes must aptitude gonna start give clarinet soon afford go write instrumental music go dedicate whatever new thing go say first thing get get rid cut tape need something think year future almost well year would kind thing would progress point think something call electronic music easel something home could make sound want could paint sound able create new thing know go one thing need get across want go new technology make music could make black white keyboard piano sound entire new music would come go happen demography economics meant go cheap everyone go meant period time new art would evolve people study conservatory like thing maybe people would different thing new art would evolve want part way could part get object one similar use year idea would work would would make put ad paper tape center invite engineer help make ad say want make future music know know idea wish could get hold idea say think something historic time never kept copy want ad probably cost one week look engineer make well think probably call electronic music easel easel nice metaphor paint music three guy come lsd movement psychedelic movement start two year idea one third san francisco drug really know none u first engineer come thought eye problem eye look two direction time incoherent talk left second one come pretty much condition begin figure go third buchla come donald buchla someone could talk good one drug one picked probably drug know coherent know drug already similar idea completely prepared move forward idea seem like large break say want key want look like come try put position need picture fiddle computer picture someone come please buchla look like first get do picture seem like big break remember time imagine involve come year idea go notion want continue columbia princeton big rca synthesizer exist come latemade old music sound bad make bleep nuance anything idea prevalent time get beginning computer technology able make music well able play low note faster write anything sort stockhausen refer thought really dumb fine musician already remember turn german keyboard magazine interviewed ask future make perfect piano say piano already perfect everything suppose whole notion seem odd still today think get technology play music already play silver apple moon moog switch bach people thought electronic music bach played electronic instrument electronic music new artform something technology demand train musician thought way go start without anything resembles tradition get rid black white keyboard immediately know music go come object like grand piano liszt chopin make music could never play take music keyboard harpsichord music played louder softer finally find genre music whole new music genre fit piano nothing else get way look something much big new metaphor music go make people necessarily grow learn music go whole different thing first person hit two stick together two stone together first person hum thing one time another caught people hum look know gonna even today hard imagine one could imagine music would want keyboard would easy go back traditional music great lead listen silver apple moon describe synthesizer yeah listen begin music morton subotnick silver apple moon first thing notice imitates anything could do piano second thing notice little pluck could do finally get four five year later realize know go even without keyboard brought back musical world exactly piano boops beep avant garde musical background think problem people future background want get rid take get point play bit second side second side cd mean second part around middle point music morton subotnick silver apple moon continued halfway music morton subotnick silver apple moon continued totally forbidden time tapped foot like make move hip hop yet rock roll really rock roll fine art world devastate tell help create electric circus big discothèque new york upstairs andy warhol velvet underground really dedicate idea demographic equalization thing everybody could get hand create beginning multimedia discothèques opening electric circus come work music originally start make silver apple moon already work part opening discothèque start heartbeat fancy occasion everybody tuxedo seiji ozawa boston symphony kennedy family big thing people money electric circus brought people make big deal start dark heartbeat ran tempo buchla design electronics place subwoofer attach floor dancehall whole floor shook literally shook inside speaker speak light bulb control buchla synthesizer do people try kind public situation beginning strobe light people hire circus tightrope dress white black light would shine blue walk across one eat banana walk across would appear different space would keep building building building get music play little bit right music morton subotnick silver apple moon continued kept move reach frenzy lo behold light get big enough could see actually everybody dance never occur anyone would think frenzy sort primitive experience technology grow thing idea anyone would groove lose question probably lose guess go ask move new york san francisco guess give chance san francisco great love san francisco thought could stay whole life major avant garde entity san francisco time year old really well know san francisco still know still think get concerned aptitude able deal knew aptitude know far could go thing begin feel like clarinet kid play flight bumblebee staccato year old people would go oh god incredible put radio thought get look year line sure go want stay could know meaningful enough san francisco become like mother mother would go oh smart course smart mother san francisco like small town really great san francisco care want really impact want something offer opportunity go new york artist residence new school art nyu gonna give enough money live could give clarinet go new york reason except thought chance really find big time stuff new york know tight public orient everything generates place feel really something new york make sense stay gonna go lawrence kansa little town middle united state schoolteacher knew could talk lecture forget try something find incapable year silver apple moon come suddenly top chart public figure thought damn never get lawrence kansa laugh surprised make dent chart oh yeah hindsight make sense moment think make ton sense well right world move towards new paradigm record player take place piano home something hear music thing predict back machine suppose bought anyone model world would like future world people would walk around bud ear see particular would personal everybody could fact make music electronic visceral heady music music really felt get get people well kind music could pick record shelf think like listen music listen could go concert understand visceral music reason switch bach good bought switch bach bought bach switch moment happen hit moment idea go hit moment door open become mainstream thing synth become mainstream synth synth point laptop moog knew bob moog quite well die lecture together panel thing go history know go rest world bob probably built synthesizer say oh guy first one far know couple module get ready someone say build synthesizer like one call synthesizer whole system say look system love idea touch plate keyboard everything know anything music say musical advisor tell use black white keyboard nobody would know name moog happen point exactly try avoid everybody start make old music electronics little new music different music keyboard caught term mass medium really take synthesizer take concept synthesizer world saw year future far tell barely begin right term demography travel lot go concert festival brought perform see lot people begin understand talk begin anyway see another world world world find easy hard one discover would black white keyboard like travel new city without iphone seem strange though popular success people caught mean top chart yes true figure day top chart come hit top almost immediately classical music chart pop chart top classical music chart point go lot washington dc minute train ride thought god maybe later year able buy automobile top chart get first royalty check even day go buy car could bought car gas go thought right top chart whole time found popular music talk point many record sell per week month classical music many reorder five record store across united state original order three get three three go reorder reorder classical include boston pop amount record huge classical music even year later boston pop sell something like year huge nothing like million record go talk popular success really popular success headline popular success sense switch bach sell nonesuch seem like strange label invest time budget label never do anything like read story good tell something know studio bleecker street show picture record silver apple record silver apple create computer stuff do record studio see bleecker street cinema doorway go flight stair right cinema studio street look bleecker street cinema sign go straight village gate rock band play work night band stop member grateful dead mother invention would pop studio people andy warhol group would pop sit around couple sofa sit around talk watch word get around mad scientist wire make crazy sound rarely real conversation watch would come meantime say forward talk public lecture new thing go happen record player would take place piano chamber music large percentage people world record company would see people would eventually say immoral unethical take beethoven string quartet intend played four people front audience replace record record fact would become new medium people would make music especially record recording would left category would black white snapshot every minute turn get rest piece study music remember meant course never believe would happen happen may get point middle work guy sit around button door door never lock lock go stair big notice say beware watch camera nothing inside thing keep people come steal everything studio walk guy around clock morning dress suit say president nonesuch record give speech think blah blah blah unethical almost word word met today set aside make first one kick thought make fun first never heard nonesuch record sound like unlikely name record company like make fun kick get home turn nonesuch record think cost cent get kid school get listen particular brandenburg concerto nonesuch record thought oh god real record company try call day long phone number part elektra asylum know next morning middle night guy come time go go knee say nothing say come near thought gonna hit something guess listen stay listen say met today upped ante offer say take become silver apple applause thought negotiate tactic laugh silver apple wild bull influence poetry sumerian poem call wild bull influence stuff make wild bull extent get name piece silver apple look name become quite literate year go college denver stay army major english literature already knew music play professionally do reading outside music become quite literate poet friend forth knew literature well remember yeats opening sound like silver apple give name wild bull little different beautiful poem consider write start sumeria early write know sumeria year ago seed felt seed happens poetry could happen result language write write language let alone printing press thought something work similar engage something similar term historic change technology make music word manipulate speak poem woman whose husband go war come back thing try make record form record side one side two side one female side side two male side music body one body sense influence tell story sort let listen briefly little snippet let listen opening music morton subotnick wild bull sound baby son time slow time manipulate go listen bit electric circus multimedia avant garde concert monday night rest dance become well know time salvatore martirano know know synthesizer call sal mar later good friend invite concert music place massachusetts woman organize say sal martirano morton subotnick electric circus thought rock roll four concert sell get found bumper sticker everything say woman make terrible mistake go think rock roll know fine concert start two sound wild bull semi live live record guy stage smile black light teeth stand sort shadow gradually first one see strange smile teeth silence think third one people start yell kind insult ran get money back remember go third one think music morton subotnick wild bull continued imagine much silence rock roll concert high one talk black white keyboard make touch plate keyboard control various thing include pitch go make slow noise certainly could piano think could violin could get pitch get quality long take get hang instrument feel could get exactly want first buchla work well year equipment need paper end year start work conceptualize logistics module gonna even imagine equipment first two three year synthesizer actually know could practice happen sequencer originally design able make long take something three voltage come per stage eight position sequencer would take gang one would go one would go maybe one would go seven would mean nine voltage take voltage nine voltage would mixed different way pair would mixed voltage two another one come back exact configuration time time seven time get long long sequence spend week tune get parameter space everything want perform period two three week listen fine tune sculpt work sequencer imagine ahead time realize absolutely engross able reason use small one seven would part rhythmic structure whereas one would control timbre kind thing rhythmic structure always small base actual rhythm alter space one two would alter slightly voltage another place get make jerky noise small group could recognize change slightly could change always thing hearing silver apple thing use word sculpt seem word use describe quite bit one stuck accurately describe painting two dimensional sculpt three dimensional music four dimensional say next last record jacket write whole thing feel like painter sculpt sound canvas time space consider even begin spatial element adjective really noun tell something directly like pitch sound hear music make couple example look laptop one talk finally get point use microphone record voice use envelope voice rather envelope generator deal sculptural space could go make mad noise energy would way sound would move space change yeah look laptop music morton subotnick spring yeah excerpt sang sang studio hearing voice hearing buchla synthesizer energy shape voice make coherent performance minute two minute long cut little piece leader sculpt sit long time listen instead sequencer hearing result voice mold cut first one make mad noise week work make another noise two day work take leader get coherent performance begin end already make like sketch fill strong procedural end result procedural result think studio art composer become studio artist mean anything anymore everybody studio artist need write music someone play put audio someone hear whereas painter sculptor sit experience change first viewer able studio spring seem like breakthrough finally able something able yeah time get felt clearly music tradition whereas the_ wild bull_ silver apple many traditional element melody forth play bit dance sky cloudless sulphur final work group visuals sue costabile new dvd come us pulse energy shape voice think new version fact perform part tomorrow night end use pulse described use one single chord cover entire range place different pitch chord string instrument never change pitch string play lot little tune within range constantly go sound like music morton subotnick sky cloudless sulphur applause us little rhythm thing described sound like exactly close enough like variation come single sequencer overall pulse like click track click track time give track tape recorder columbia put click track top click track make tongue tongue go make whir noise loop hear slight buchla tomorrow night actually introduce straight pulse use tongue minute get straight pulse constant machine click get random change velocity make make whir noise machine hear hear slight dropout feel like put hand pulse point actually little hole live without tongue building voltage velocity pulse vary back put random voltage one offset another one add two different thing never quite come back sound live human feel voice source music long time seem keep talk use voice remember year ago talk say first time ever hit two rock together hit chart wild bull hit top chart fact spain right spain summer silver apple moon ponder whole issue someone give house mijas stayed almost four month try deal thing top chart felt like could write orchestra piece like silver apple moon fact summer write orchestra piece get family laughter okay finally come head realize get back first rock hit two rock together realize inside rock voice begin use voice call buchla think say need something translate vocal sound straight voltage far know first envelope follower come may others around know certainly first begin play gradually piece get together really artform last thing want touch opening question video sue costabile thing dvd tomorrow night go work lillevan saw poland unsound recently struck fact face audience face screen visuals guess partly show amaze instrument face screen look screen face want buchla see actually something play turn something go actually play think important least stage game give laptop use ableton buchla go ableton oscillator get duplicate five six time different thing oscillator five oscillator three oscillator one multiplies use sample get live go back visuals briefly lillevan collaborative process like start described way back use visuals first performance two vision large two thought future one record medium record pure music something listen take personally individual personal even audience course pod ear living room forth happens public performance record like studio perfect come give someone else guaranteed person give really like good could give listen forever living room live performance opposite live performance moment could fail kind drama theatrical also felt begin dimension music record four dimension get spatial dimension timbre world sound live performance world people hand right wave hand listen radio mean something mean something lean face forward say intend different meaning lean back mean something lean forward mean something different live performance visual component perform musical instrument see performer play electronics see kinetic response imagine could get computer would like entire orchestra train beck call play every note mold like conductor make decision time composer perform sense spontaneous gonna come way file could play soft would mean one kind thing need go detail felt begin could kinetic visual component parallel piece somebody improvise stuff know music willing listen way differently time go visual kinetic vocabulary counterpart stick chin something since work tony martin long time still occasionally found lillevan brought commission opera visuals idea produce real work finally jacob room get played bregenzer austria dresden berlin vienna last year warsaw autumn september lillevan live video met begin work together visuals appeal much much content visuals though like much way work make kinetic decision basis make musical decision deal something increase energy fast slow see sue costabile use bar fluctuate like work much quite mind electric circus pulse something music interprets kinetic energy music kinetic visual energy parallel direct really look like sue happy work always try get little complex performance new york together expand vocabulary quite bit closer lillevan point look different well let open question audience could wait microphone wonderful interested say earlier talk primitive experience technology wonder mean join two world primitive electronic difference two let take first part meant primitive say first part say primitive experience technology yeah remember say sure laughter depends say two form primitive experience think ur experience primal experience start scratch hard much nobody really think way people sing happy birthday together go together sing note shape primitive sings gesture shape matter particularly whether c e understand human being animal give music oh unless sing right note musical keyboard thing try avoid go sings go c g c c sharp go get register way like sound without worry pitch ear train way end c g meant keyboard stuck whatever tune get point get gesture inside find way express think meant primitive part question go ask another question silence mean important role music create silence say right way mean john cage meant different way think actually never conversation always assume meant differently silence part fabric ask long note last actually ask begin end say rhythm timing note ta ta ta ta actually quarter note long start silence silence designator anticipation next sound next sound go dah dah dah groan part dimension time sound time go daa daa daa different dah dah dah work silence john think talk aspect talk timbre world sound talk musical silence deal use silence quite dramatically wild bull example yes pulse matter personal intention question ask loud go give listen long silence little restless people question regard music visual presentation watch lot horror movie listen soundtrack hear lot borrow texture mood music especially first piece silver apple lot prickly stuff ever think want create sense unease listener feel use create sense unease answer think aware something horror movie sound like music definitely borrow could know use get letter latesaying saw strange green creature come bedroom listen silver apple mind answer question mind mean mind rest problem use however go use remember correctly wealthy man new york proud fact played silver apple moon every halloween house would scare people one point macy use halloween display must effect people never intend message jean paul sartre say essay music mean anything meaningful draw meaning meaningfulness everybody differently one nice thing interested technological part like control part big deal lose black white keyboard see technology nowadays control example buchla see opportunity use newer technology touch response use voice envelope follower use touch plate keyboard well design period use reason use touch much control fingertip much extension emotion lot thing voice much nose toe experiment lot use thing space even something gentle hand like flutter hand slightly really come fingertip touch something get real extension picture somewhere website sensor glass heat sensor look close eye anyone close eye less heat reflection light white eyeball could actually measure relative movement use controller one point none kind control get get voice fingertip like wide open put sensor body brain control brain could heart rate want heart move fast use tongue depends wannawant extension like answer ur quality inside energy behind music turn sound far two thing found meaningful finger pressure placement finger black white keyboard voice curious come san francisco everyone high lazy kind casual go new york little aggressive music change influence probably intend probably know answer know sometimes wonder would happen stayed san francisco wonder would happen flop go lawrence kansa probably right new music excite recent music people music something modern listen ask lot say think way categorize categorize thing fact one thing learn judge hearing first time like destine go back listen see like like less tell recent music like much messiaen developed aesthetic discover know one aesthetic latebegan give name ecstatic moment music tends attract live performance tomorrow go use gonna prepare set gonna freestyle thing combination use buchla live move ableton sample everything spontaneous decision happens happens set resource patch analog synthesizer computer limited get chosen performance sample although change pitch time bring whenever want even pulse send get pulse thing go oscillator take one sample go play pas oscillator buchla get pulse instead played normal form array set available material play lot lately performance last four week many city bag trick try much new stuff time go wonder practice practice practice technique way traditional instrumentalist practice way instrumentalist develop new technique particular kind thing get really good know gonna use gradually move performance never play minute begin end never know long show go go practice try little part go back build new technique like get rid everything learn gonna come new procedure go practice use clarinet gonna end performance might well record point well developed philosophy sound music use word awe ecstatic peer la monte young terry riley pauline oliveros developed spiritual philosophy go sound music also laugh thank allergy salute officer religion go restaurant cannot stop marvel tree hang tail actually sit table howl moon scream coo somehow make eroica symphony line awe human natural evolution much spirituality awe experience get tell truth still crazy people run world manage sit talk like really amaze let hope keep go mention earlier use sample talk visual element assign certain visual certain sound use sampler conjunction visual processor think concept one sound associate one image one clip audio visual always two separately developed idea think something like color organ scriabin kind stuff personally oppose kind lock perfectly happy someone else think gesturally think timbre result gesture pure thing make mad sound dimensional stuff aah ooh combination thing color object particular sound sound produce want produce need color say grunt hold hand thing voice respond emotionally way could go grunt groan mean something different voice almost think color amplify give dimension experience use color root want sound color want sound visual want sound sound expression underneath also do visual visual parallel aspect hear get something happens add something musical experience whether dance whatever begin develop large context people build context sound particular theatrical situation want music communicate use anything addition music want go beyond public arena use visuals want composite experience bring context individual need bring thing tell exactly say listen watch say get context understand necessary get message know make sense well thank much morton
