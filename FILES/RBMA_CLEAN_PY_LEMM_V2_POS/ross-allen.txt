major label suffer one give shit major label people see rap scene music screw last drop money cheapest packaging cut overhead want label actually like packaging difficult know go go public want take music distribution well think lead way format gradually push side surprise could see time people go go computer type label band people go buy music straight source currently situation probably similar mine major distribution company distribution deal throughout world separate situation country yeah kind work get promotion marketing situation kind work think bit situation kind final extreme say start label ultimately want go big distribution coverage initially want local distribution want national international depend upon ripple record sends around world know speak download mp make footnote ipod situation apple start itunes store within first week sell billion downloads think still today number one download site thought inspire format future sell music downloads think think get future
