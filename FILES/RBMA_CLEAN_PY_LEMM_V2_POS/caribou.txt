say computer go number one question still get ask software use one people say basically thing plug in different effect various degree poorly well allow sequence sample chop effect use acid fact make album acid like demo program kid use software big deal learn different softwar turn immediately know use get kind technical business way get express idea really basic software obviously sample record guitar cheap like set show set keyboard people like plug like oh one battery yamaha kid keyboard whatever make sound album say set play live anybody see band play live support record los angeles crack

interpret music still really sample base electronic music live set end really happy tour world do show past year whatever empty full really good experience like say finally get connect people like music people come show people say time think really chronic problem much dance music obviously people sometimes superstar dj like wait minute guy play record like joe schmo two door street people like oh man fade thing cut bass whatever like uhh talk feel really difficult thing convey music make predominantly machine machine live context do tour play laptop sequence thing live acid find reward actually play live personal thing do studio work actually get relationship audience get feedback find quite reward yeah massively massively reward really comparison perspective show laptop show play front people quite physical contact people quite full aggressive kind show get idea example new album play together become compact unit funny people always ask see band show kind expect next album record band play lot instrument stuff still want make indie rock record band record still think tool sample thing digitally conjunction play live make something obviously last year something kind new people band like classically train people come type field actually friend mine knew good musician even know drummer played drum like play drum like yeah use play drum high school turn guy like man mountain sits like imitates swing arm around work put thing together fly cross finger kind work hop know may able round quintessential tip love song really love great drum program particularly song like cherrybomb couple song first record tell u little bit might drum sample think lot time whole drum program break aspect obviously come koushik big influence introduce lot hip hop music lot breakbeat kind funk soul rock jazz kind look distinct sound either way chop break kind interest sound different quality whatever sometimes think simplest drum program best sometimes chop thing much muddies idea sometimes chop thing leave way drummer would never play add give interest quality think thing ear beauty remove layer technology acid simple use literally chop thing sampler whatever become really familiar ear technique much fiddle around find something sound interest sound different guess question really anything else say put another track yeah also talk title oh yeah yeah thing title seminar artist formerly know manitoba know may something interest definitely act warn signal people release music whatever release record name manitoba manitoba province canada like ontario another province receive letter record label email say cease desist cease desist order lawyer client guy musician call handsome dick manitoba actually chose name look interest word thing connection look internet anybody else kind similarly related name guy handsome dick manitoba first laughter like obviously go sue like smith sue john smith something know mean word common whatever obviously go sue ball roll difficult people know music name manitoba see listing manitoba go show whatever lawsuit u say use name manitoba context handsome dick manitoba past year real lesson practicality music law something interested get force situation even though sound ridiculous music lover make ramones esque punk rock make electronic music never release anything name manitoba closest come manitoba wild kingdom like joke call bunch lawyer state like actually joke main reason expensive afford go court like much would cost fight say well maybe u dollar lawyer fee pay lawyer fight like kid ridiculous turn money either friend lawyer quite reputable lawyer work free everything kind stack well obviously say perspective kind felt real nail coffin happen release name go know caribou album release worldwide name caribou know even say word manitoba within month sound totally ridiculous would laugh actually talk lawyer people like actually precedent court amount money would cost fight ridiculous thing decide factor really long use name use three year go record another album go come caribou album go release caribou unintelligible question potentially song title worried think word caution release music careful massive disruption make music something really sudden think lawyer trademark thing seem irrelevant name actually go people associate music kind important call arrowsmith something laughter trademark new name yeah know whether recommend people thing trademark name cost actually every single territory take chance maybe trademark romania somewhere cost dude bedroom make music much start think tricky thing advise guess careful choose name hopefully unique like thought do happen label change name label inform found internet happen email website email label email

somebody door know brother like brother maybe know somehow laughter go door like sorry serve private investigator subpoening court like summons go court lawsuit file actually find person person deliver guy hire private investigator point heard guy still thought c mon must kid maybe money something like know look serious like oh goodness totally insane forgot put egon guest list night end pay ticket laughter mind surprised still invite glad bought shirt say manitoba go like star war merchandise year laughter could tell little bit collaboration ninja tune contact always felt really disconnect start release music realize many independent label interest thing odds somebody talk know somebody whatever get touch say really music would like remix end remix mr scruff world independent music big think first also recently move london go school base could talk little bit take bedroom studio music live change process along way immediate motivation necessity show make sense kind music way track sound example play laptop vocal stuff like get turn kind live show kind live show like kind dynamic effect people play real instrument hit thing get really practice song kind inform way work studio always thought try make thing sound live anyway like dance music electronic music feel little time feel human contact kind always aim make music sound bit live anyway add whole element musical process instead make album sit void get go perform music song take different tone sound different different character live think really useful also kind get sense different thing work get sense dj thing work differently people listen music home club know might get song thing minute really repetitive put home like point play club whether dj whatever something really loud repetitive exactly effect want whether play band like play one chord minute would stun different atmosphere live suppose sequence click track go play live yeah track play live another thing want incorporate video various reason make think definitely way go see band like flame lip see like guy wear back see get something ear pay attention lot band use click track also want something video video sync make sense music actually work everything dvd video also send click track signal play click track easily cheaply sync u normal dvd player sync u video problem burn dvd click kind tie long song next time around think go return use computer use software video also change thing fly put different bit video bit flexible excuse click track click track something audience hear hear headphone like click click click keep u time sample come many thing go album able play part live thing come sample obviously sync u video click keep u time element say stuff cd acid uh huh much get do do go studio get mixed straight master house master house mix everything home computer acid exactly way know sure people give lot different message obviously lot different result could want get music example madlib stone throw one big influence music always sound really raw character bass muggy sound sometimes exactly like music everybody perfect clean sound record drum exactly way would really boring listen record kind feel like add element interest thing happen exactly right tool someone totally professional like wait minute get get k zanzithophone man get get bit random element problem sound sample high pa sometimes low play two drumkits many instrument get cd player run sampler problem definitely realize go sound engineer know material travel u time sound engineer u time able make adjustment kind thing something worry everything come laptop mix anything definitely necessity point good thing tune thing room make adjustment like sync dvd like every show less yes another element band write verse chorus kind song go play song like record people like hey like song sound cause live context go play live show play music release play anything sound like music could imagine people come show like like hey like one track mr obtuse probably like like one track album play one also element kind want return play music obviously arrange differently music people knew really quite important thing even try experimental music kind connection people come show response question next time around move dvd player back laptop able extend version fly cut bit put new sample fly change video kinda thing mean video sync different way return back sequence live yeah mean could prepared bit video like loop go time video five drop different one time guess people video different bit random bit video mix think something really excite enter think interest say experimental music one thing david matthew say u sit fine make experimental music one thing keep back head guy obviously whole bunch experimental music lot go go year five year played lot way production value guy earlyholger czukay bass player engineer group record hour music cut splice tape primitive drum machine play along one great rock drummer jaki liebezeit ever live probably experimental music return something return music hear explain process go make actual mechanic sound bizarre person like use sp something front mix board kind stuff great music hear could experimental want go return sometime would reckon always really really important grow listen melody always really key thing end day either really good production really good melody harmony go differentiate music everybody else either go like never heard anything sound like amaze song go one two thing optimal thing obviously would see interested music element would try combine band like manage study stockhausen totally weird experimental like egon say chop tape collaging sound like also melody get stuck head maybe poppy britney spear whatever get element melody stay always important would track britney spear would track britney spear carte blanche allow would sure actually probably definitely would like go rent next couple year whatever laughter talk background pianist interest free jazz improvisation wonder incorporate live show sequence whether bar formula get break something different every night even improvisational element live show definitely kind right tie structure music part last bar whatever way tie like majority sound come sample run around sort stuff definitely want seem like puppet show smile play keyboard like imitates goofy limp hand play style much possibly end play quite lot instrument whatever could differently every night want definitely freedom mic stage lot different element example mic thumb piano tiny little machine monitor stuff stage yeah monitor obviously sound engineer take care technical detail microphone use also totally clueless sort thing really much technical knowledge small instrument played sm standard shure microphone far live sound especially europe get lot show fancy microphone play cleveland man lucky three microphone take microphone go obviously tell need many work oh know channel something like play room size two drumkits really need mic drumkits much cut corner place another question communication amongst band member find rehearsal get feel music communication sometimes electronic music much one person direction find make music band communication happens make music alive earlier allude release album record process album definitely see whole side live band play musician obviously developed rapport play long great kind see separate still want make music bit sample base kind element also think kind excite say played gig general response experiment stage sorry get train catch manitoba caribou gesture caribou get leaf favorite part tour mean bit control freak studio bedroom whatever get everything set everything set every time tour anyone go djed played live context know show one night festival italy arezzo wave festival played main stage really fit electronic stage put u main stage football stadium front people like man insane never played front like people walk literally sea people like maybe go make sense respond really really well obviously amaze fly somewhere else play people ceiling right motion inch head pa terrible totally amaze bad gig whatever really good never know go happen like yeah play town good terrible weird little town great really invigorate people small town know music come gig town good people know song ever work band create since jazz ever get jam feel sometimes happens free jazz first question part record record go back bit control freak really main reason like get really early stay six morning record stuff really enjoy able time want right right beside book studio two hour go make music schedule whenever want band would tough organize get everyone together really main reason make music individual guess obviously pro con either play live play jazz instrument much like noise improvisation make thing sound different record lot feedback lot different drum passage whatever kind make music use free jazz sample interaction musician interest free jazz music kind inform way play cool think wrap perfect thank applause
