jazz r b mix two element even though sound normal point bit sure even grow kind unspoken thing either played r b pop played jazz certain snobbery associate play jazz whether could really play like say either played one extend course first first record jazz purist hat like early byrd stuff early byrd stuff blue note kind time cut cut two three track first six month later six month blue note debate really want go direction historically class act straight ahead jazz label finally byrd prevail want go direction much critic dismay get grammy nomination big sell record blue note history kind kick new type instrumental music really never call jazz u instrumental funk solo vocal people put label put straitjacket even care jumping category groove rhythm section important part sound interested know construct track would start rhythm would building block would build entry point melody groove start track larry jamming home take studio play player say want something like would follow rhythm track would start lot time cut rhythm track idea go go top depend come would go important bassline guy try construct hear shift gear fallin like domino seem like bassline lot way guess also separate straight jazz far limited category jazz bassline important drum groove instrument like say earlier fiend drum sound drum groove basslines approach work make lot easy great musician chuck raney extension style james jameson funk brother yeah lot tune write around basslines synthesizer come would say earlier double basslines reinforce always look muscular kick drum work hard get bass overpower certainly coincidence people always mining record drum sample stuff certain sound like trademark mizell production thing crispy drum crispy hi hat something articulate really wonder secret record stuff good engineer good studio really sat top mix drum bass would work one thing engineer use put separate mic hi hat realize early funk come th drummer played hi hat really played normally put overhead snare mic two snare mics kick drum mic want hi hat bring overhead mean get tom everything else put mic hi hat engineer like use many mics phase problem deal one thing yeah drum bass fanatic one thing vocal background sing first album do enjoy yeah distinctive sound know double part would sound like group sometimes would fonce vocal eight nine pass different harmony one thing actually listen deeply record much go never ever sound busy never sound crowd texture never sound crowd another conscious thing keep thing light mix function player interact show think twice example guy would sit would play jerry peter played piano would certain arpeggio harvey drummer would pick next time come around would nail lick piano lick jerry played time guitar player john rowin kind cool conservative guy could really play butt would sit next wah wah could play butt aggressive personality would get right john face would look real interactive vibe everybody everybody chop everybody bring best tell music johnny hammond tell another thing strike album look donald byrd johnny hammond none track track track really tight well never longer long noodling indulgent solo essence term number track cut album conscious decision well keep really tight much time play limited technology time vinyl record drum bass freak low frequency create wider groove cut disc master limited ideally get decent radio level minute ideal would overcut well album cognizant available cd minute mean see album track quite astound ok time open floor sure quite question come shy two question really since get array hit tip make sure get thrown one hit wonder bin also long array track choose go onto album get thrown away would repeat first question feel one hit wonder tip become one hit wonder bad good big fan one hit wonder far tip longevity name game music business come experience song see song last way artist fade away think certain artist usually think song first thing come mind think artist tune artist surpass level touch make song classic people like ella fitzgerald sinatra thing risen streisand song u make sure write speak certain level arrangement present without doubt song come pick

never work ran mix song studio big fan rance like knew rance think release one day song marvin gaye played hope talk universal tune release go strangely release three different time three different marvin compilation still creative release woman world could feel track finish need sweeten whatever like rawness track anyway hopefully come sens tune think put album woman world different arrangement would slow know slow blue note compilation come last year tune call n r time listen lot understand element record know incredible drum track harvey mason wonder could speak tune n r stand track blue note sent u album remix get pro tool track basically strip drum write whole groove top overdubbed part brought people put vocal reconstruct n r time drum groove heard multi track convince u never release first place really cut thought do last year overdubs except drum one thing think lecture end hear marvin gaye tune one last time laughter sure sure another question way think anywhere notice next collaboration come hero madlib wonder get together guy like work guy whether jam guy way back met dego hero would come state friend acquaintance fan music put u together lady name felice la seirra dego come house really talk much go dinner left cd like cut livestrings refresh live period musicality would go take groove lay great london december mix single come end january get together

outtake byrd j irreplaceable stuff vintage stuff d clav arp odyssey actually put together help ebay get fender rhodes impressed new software stuff come tell difference vintage stuff still around entirely look back time think lose really good sound everything today sound really plastic ok new technology think warm detailed still wait see pro tool high limit k us lot memory people say k sound

join play marvin gaye next question mention man chuck davis built sound enhancer also say guy fortunate great engineer ever blur line guy step producer engineer mode want move mics around hit faders also engineering background come find tweak box get space age sound really blur line fader level snare kick eq bit processing type reverb plate emts natural chamber left engineer want concentrate music kept line creative lean far engineering background also kept engineering part really interest today today need ground electronics physic necessarily degree whole lot need learn understand program today find interest today engineering wise philosophical question listen contemporary producer album start rock finish r b every time listen new album something reminds past feel heard single album completely new get feel nothing new nowadays compose question year sit talk heritage give u talk new producer creative potential contemporary musician low nothing completely new nowadays skream afternoon though laugh commercial aspect four major record company independent label existeds nurture artistic stretch bottom line sell certain amount get drop certain amount certain time stay artist factor people chase hit unwilling step business mind r people major record label guy come totally creative sense commercialism see week totally inspire mix match musical style see hope major label right whole model change go internet distribution label scramble figure point existence become distributor relevant hopefully guy change heard think twice different layer talk would cue different section record process card b c change alto solo gary bartz tune change think possibly favorite eight bar music wonder could talk specific chord progression possibly even demonstrate rhodes applause would somewhat difficult look chart get lot chord mind particular section talk gary come b section actually happens start song extend part end famously sample tribe call quest discover perhaps signature mizell chord progression could lay u uh huh laughter lot minor chord progression favor throw different modulation minor key would vary fender rhodes awaits get tonight let show tonight good teaser ok marvin gaye marvin gaye
