lot thing heard week would possible without pioneer work men like gentleman sit next great privilege welcome mr tom oberheim applause glad education already maybe talk later go awful lot history cover even start talk physic yet lot thing information process week come figure might good chance two three minute let sink get ready one ready hmm audio ready music united state america love song dead che wish anything might want ask come talk synthesis heck play hippie psychedelic folky nonsense well tom oberheim might actually information song way call love song dead che band call united state america oh gosh forgot believe two people kind know pretty well like certain joseph byrd dorothy moskowitz want tell u bit first oberheim record record make oberheim synthesizer student ucla los angeles even though physic student always music department time take class physic go back music department met guy name joseph byrd incredible experimental music ucla midclassical music actually happening music later become know pretty well girlfriend name dorothy finish degree go computer engineering start band call united state america last less one year make two record band interest people interest kind story oh important part story original band broke always fought know nowadays fight everybody happy day people fought broke band singer start band different people original band device call ring modulator design guy never met band broke take ring modulator go start band come knew engineer say build ring modulator begin oberheim built ring modulator lead believe one main reason sound first album second kind change yeah could different obviously take lot thing grant day say oh get physic degree build ring modulator actually find build ha well girl dorothy come say tom need build u ring modulator well idea computer engineer six seven year go ucla library spent several hour look book found book circuit diagram figure circuit would interest musician anyway kept look finally found article magazine famous engineer originally germany move americadesigned organ start design stuff make electronic music even moog design modular synthesizer design modular electronic music system one thing ring modulator explain ring modulator could use music take start make ring modulators harald bode guy talk believe actually article inspire bob moog well well good friend mr bode old guy bob moog earlycollege begin think way bode like mentor bob idea take circuit make module could hook together patch cord course first moog synthesizer basic idea come bode moog add onto brought oscillator filter envelope generator birth analogue synthesizer know combination two guy work time like many u grow know much thing born different manhattan slightly different one big apple ha ha yeah born small town center united state state call kansa grow built stereo friend stereo invent building hi fi friend start electronics junior high school built amplifier people later start much musician friend met ucla radio absolute intricate fascination kid well least fm radio could turn dial get weird frequency somewhere line split like one look new station one take screwdriver take apart well think know talk look eye someone today people willing experiment electronics sound whether electronic thinkconventional facility present experimental music like today mean long time ago year ago go music school first learnt bach learnt beethoven take special interest people break experimental stuff start slow everybody heard strange sound come fm radio ready make music take much time develop think take step back year old literally take mum radio apart experiment sound radio grow big band jazz listen stan kenton band like friend would get together play record different band see trumpet player could play high note something like much later start experiment electronics actually make music really pioneer moog second generation take break interested conventional music interest thing talk talk arp thing speak interest thing rumor like many great include merle haggard share deep love train yes friend mine use study clock night go train station wait train go go chicago los angeles dream go big city many year later whether cold winter day winter night watch train go dream big city nevertheless kansa state pretty renowned university great later become well day interested music mean get music late sure know fugue counterpoint music student learn play piano whatever learn word fugue dave brubeck jazz album know anything music high school study music later kind come different way normal piano lesson music school none listen record back stilldrove parent crazy one record ninth grade sauter finegan orchestra group earlyone song played hour drove parent nut maybe something might happen later one two people might know feel yes laugh initial feel leave kansa behind go west say listen lot jazz high school decide go manhattan earn money go back college work school every day met people old also day read magazine still existence mainly jazz call downbeat back magazine little ad different thing one ad jazz club los angeles basically ad say come jazz club free tell buy two drink thought wow go hear great jazz musician pay ready go california someone say tom go california say great wannacome go california never regret good move la exactly small village earth go town center kind need anchor point navigate well arrive july pocket job parent money back kansa totally live cheaply day petrol cost quarter euro per gallon incredibly cheap afford go good restaurant entertainment would fill car broken car barely ran drive around los angeles learn city could become taxi driver knew city well profession choose well get los angeles first work aircraft company first job could find job pretty boring december year old saw ad draftsman trainee job draw engineer drawing company call national cash register big company america go apply job turn company early company computer business even know computer get lowly guy college degree yet high school give job little draft experience get company like first time saw mixer saw synthesizer heard music like instantaneous love something computer idea computer technology day course computer go wall one computer thought want idea go back university year old great time big city work company saw engineer building incredible thing call computer thought knew go back college company let stay work part time go ucla point plan anything computer engineer rest life work big company quite job various kind well know company day well work six seven computer company kind guy like job left place work year one computer company work three week like bos left ten year seven job age resume show many job everybody would say well something wrong good worker always leave say ah care fun job good left think common job take use major military provider lockheed nasa people nowadays seem underestimate connection sound synthesis military industrial complex lot people think world understand essence art mean everything music painting poetry happening whatever maybe red bull exception typical company interested artistic side world interested make money rare connection art military industrial complex happens company successful throw little money art common u know europe hear oh yes ibm sponsor something museum course tiny fraction total income contribute art art one stepchild society usually quite struggle people think consider one stepchild could give u one two example something take military world technologically create art first get involve electronic music first thing maestro ring modulator later another pedal first thing start sell arp synthesizer first arp synthesizer dealer west coast thing characterize arp arp synthesizer maybe rich sound moog design engineer call alan r pearlman arp ten year design circuit military turn certain circuit need design industrial military purpose actually also useful synthesizer probably important one knew design oscillator drift love minimoog reputation drift problem think year go found solution pearlman experience design circuit industry knew way design oscillator drift oscillator one thing need know get actually pedestrian explanation thing ring modulator yes ok ring modulator really simple device make complex sound sure enough experience music enough appreciate would call harmonic aspect music base overtone series think human being naturally attune word octave frequency ratio two one major fifth frequency ratio close three two thing exists western music african tribal music idea fifth fourth octave something universal human base frequency related ratio ring modulator totally destroys thing ear attune change frequency absolute amount frequency let give example put hz tone one side ring modulator hz tone side ring modulator get hz minus hz plus totally non harmonic mind find nice pleasant sound yet always pleasant ring modulator destroys harmonic thing use hand great musician unfortunately bring ring modulator today early day sell ring modulators musician like herbie hancock chick corea many people like make really great stuff crazy sound get ring modulator add subtracts frequency rather multiply ratio happens pretty sure get short note like say even understand thing still feel like art aesthetic relationship like design whatever whatever believe met another person ucla challenge different side like guy elli people might know different context oh yes one guy met ucla jazz trumpet player name elli go start innovative jazz big band become famous band song write arrange typically time time whatever get know well one people built equipment start oberheim would ring modulators trumpet octave divider really interest experimental musicworking also instrumental part get music thing united state america elli people saw future subtle way ten year tire design computer stuff ready something else lead electronic music instrument brings u little thing brings slide show well first commercial product call maestro ring modulator find picture electronically far box graphic much different company sell like little bit adventurous go look wish picture first product great thing maybe one internet look one earlier today find one interviewer go letterhead start oberheim company traditional way go company design logo letterhead show slide would use write letter although really never write many letter guy design logo big los angeles advertising art scene back comic comic art popular advertising many year ago roll stone always column guy call robert crumb main character big foot always stick call trucking note trucking ever heard phrase call trucking note one time great logo unfortunately longer get story later point original oberheim ring modulator logo front big beautiful explode graphic name oberheim explode typeface beautiful like want conventional black silver guess pretty mind blowing even detail like logo like get people rather know film american splendor else really roundabout way seem like lot thing happen small entity despite really big city well influence time start oberheim really sick design computer do ten year really want guy design ad agency help far music go big advertisement agency spend lot money like friend stuff creative time idea would ever successful company bedroom start work quite decent job hour day go business know always work much work seven computer type company enjoy computer design interest profession people do little chip do little individual part several year experience work experimental musician excite part perform musician really instrumental musician get joy stuff musician friend well talk later always drive force make something musician take creates something else ready leave computer thing even small make money happy well musician friend one side game want go business place would go look investment might start neighbor well go around get money friend enough get start think total investment thought lot money much start company business plan plan able pay back anything lot money rumor thousand five six come neighbor oh yes know talk well know meaning first investor guy work company secret work u government war game study would happen soviet union attack united state many bomber need respond kind crazy stuff political world united state turn upside friend neighbor mine go public call pentagon paper basically told story defense department u government show war vietnam disaster everybody thought go win war document come within u defense department actually say way win war one guy make public neighbor friend help point well company help get logo design get letterhead design paper well xerox machine pentagon paper print course year old story interest people remember horrible time crazy war sound like today america crazy war heard one start wonder give money back right court case well come year invest sum say tom need investment back say fine give back last time ever saw next time heard anything someone knock door say hello mr oberheim fbi see mr russo guy name tony russo say see many month know found later u government come guy make paper public friend helper fbi knock door well day sell lot record back little thing get quite phone call especially los angeles film capital right probably one thing get go decide start business design particular ring modulator design specifically perform musician design ring modulators earlier version learn make word get around music community los angeles thing call ring modulator get phone call movie composer say movie want use ring modulator movie soundtrack soundtrack movie call beneath planet ape take ring modulator studio use soundtrack break several people movie orchestra come say oooh buy one really start business really like see every night street cerveza beer go approach people like original merchant quite understand really like face face business stage well yes make local musician los angeles decide go make one ring modulator time think begin rack mount type thing decide time music pretty much jazz think history book say start mile davis start lateforget album insist chick corea keith jarrett two famous keyboard player play want play acoustic piano want play fender rhodes piano turn sound musician discover become popular time electronic music start heard synthesizer record possible time take synthesizer road unless course keith emerson get roadies big truck small synthesizer yet start sell lot ring modulators people would use fender rhodes piano record able find today either herbie hancock chick corea play solo fender rhodes ring modulator within jazz community cause similar reaction bob dylan play electrify guitar newport folk festival think crowd reaction dylan play electric guitar little different well know sure keith jarrett really want play electronics say interview hate electronics think jazz musician kind experimental work ring modulators immediately make musical thing accepted case dylan example much musical rejection like hero play electric big part business time another object similar size could explain phase shifter oh stillone thing met musician ucla friend laterwould call folk rock know call first met kind stuff lead eagle whatever people need electronic device traditional music record built sound amplification equipment question phase shifter oh yeah group musician still high school first start work try everything one thing discover listen george harrison play guitar leslie speaker remember beatles song recently read really great book one engineer make lot beatles recording friend fascinate idea instead play guitar amp play leslie rotate organ speaker thought great sound thought well great sound look another product start experiment make long story short found circuit call phase shifter circuit simulated sound swishy sound get leslie speaker time sell ring modulators big marketing company take phase shifter interested next three four year sell hundred thousand phase shifter mxr company first phase shifter market really put business point enough money thing fun stuff yeah mean quite transition go solder together circuit friend sell many unit say three four year hundred thousand time company three four people take four year really excite say america bean rice mean little money buy much actually start make money company excite time time talk everything hand make workshop place day oberheim one fourth size room two three people day make phase shifter good time long work recreate something like mean sound like conveyor belt work make ship door would boring work time get phone call someone like herbie hancock jan hammer say tom love phase shifter could work hour way year make electronic music stuff make stuff sell make money hear later play music oberheim like even today still thrill build something process always use engineering knowledge love music first step build instrument process finish start process process end machine make hand musician complete process even something simple phase shifter part process feedback great musician come say tom love love ring modulator love phase shifter course later thing like turn crank thrill thing still fun feel bit like unleash sonic nuke well guess people room look forward great lawyer great business manager big company make music something make music hard explain people case make music part process case process fulfil excite play music make instrument either go hear musician play well start lp cd let face everybody world creative good thing different people otherwise get job insurance company bank whatever important thing climb ladder success important case hit synthesizer like hit record sure still process different u driven different power think deal different power day day basis sudden get face reality first namm show look back year later seem like happen rather quickly get ring modulator phase shifter able go trade show part process building happen overnight rarely happen fast work mean design sell go trade show meeting musician mean try imagine arp also sell someone trade show would like imagine quite different anaheim frankfurt music fair well ring modulator phase shifter look way make little money keep company go start become arp dealer think refer show arp trade show sell los angeles different musician studio musician movie well lot jazz people start sell rock musician earlysure answer look something interest one hand go show still interest see atmosphere represent something built hand whereas thing get something pretty alright thing probably let benefit different level first start go trade show like namm show see people first oberheim product sell big company chicago sell go trade show see people different pedal synthesizer start get idea sure quite go way find thing mean synthesizer synthesizer accepted movie musicpioneer guy los angeles synthesizer expert designer user get know real well introduction synthesizer around remember talk synthesizer work beach boy thing synthesizer knew theremin know good vibration point whooo whooo whoooo guy good vibration theremin group people la kind middle people start use synthesizer start grow part big contributor yet see develop grow guy idea ever see movie say sound thx think company come together fat harmonic chord well kind poor digital copy guy two large moog synthesizer make hair stand end hear really good version record friend earlybrought sound alone great anyway name paul beaver really pioneer learnt lot think spark want involve synthesizer begin show thing make think thing really interest could help u bit recall moment stand arp whether front software classic analog piece button faders stuff want create sound use general technique find way maneuver around surface thing day oberheim start build synthesizer young engineer come say tom really want build synthesizer say ok well explain basic analogue synthesizer patch call basic patch say mean know basic patch say ok well goodbye could get real philosophical talk relates physic whatever cliffsnotes version yeah ok take arp minimoog large moog analog synth place start work simple two oscillator choose different wave form may track keyboard depend adventurous two oscillator go simple two input mixer voltage control filter voltage control filter go voltage control amplifier envelope generator modulate filter envelope generator modulate vca mean could take everything two oscillator mix vcf two envelope generator vca could make incredible analog synthesizer music power analog synthesis idea basic patch simple understand mechanical point view know oscillator oscillator filter vca envelope generator envelope generator heard synthesizer music analog synthesizer music essence everything else like windshield wiper car need nice something basic patch understand understand make good sound essence analogue synthesis simple learn read obscure little book actually arp owner manual talk page one understand basic everything else add one one basic patch make great sound obviously chance go eight million different tangent get quick show hand want one one element like waveform stuff interest yes maybe later ok well good half take well keep mind basic two oscillator filter vca two envelope generator three oscillator always expand come waveform waveform like orchestra difference flute violin want flute want violin want clarinet case want sawtooth square wave sinewave really easy concept change waveform change quality change basic patch still oscillator filter envelope modulation want little different quality change waveform sawtooth pulse want sound move time modulate one thing keep mind basic patch change little element one one probably graphic karaoke version mean get oscillator first thing start well best way make really awful synthesizer sound work one oscillator always two really need three three add little one first basic lesson learn well least think try make really good sound one two oscillator get overall write quality different thing filter filter actually mean let start something simple say sine wave sine wave good example go amateur teach u idea behind filter change overtone come want high end open filter want mellow sound low filter important modulate filter make filter set move time envelope generator lead sound hear especially early synthesizer day another thing filter add call resonance make little peak sound use envelope change filter frequency resonance turn get famous pweeeeeeoooooww sound use probably much add thing one one see creativity musician use thing come together make real music lot later machine credit fat warm sound category apply engineer sense well course something deal year make synthesizer oberheim certain sound minimoog certain sound never heard good engineering explanation minimoog sound well say lesser synthesizer engineering point view probably complex analyze whether minimoog filter oberheim filter little bit distortion way harmonic subtract change filter frequency explain engineering point view ear much sensitive sound many way use piece test equipment like studio people say would never use digital mixer want sound analog fader know people still ear brain much sensitive engineering instrument mention moog late robert moog much argue still part ghost men make machine well get know bob moog quite well although east coast guy west coast guy see often bob kind person forget warm funny guy snob could go drink two lot fun quality like think similar quality know engineer quality appreciate like result engineering work mention wonderful music come great musician use equipment mean great fame mean great devotion course well know good friend keith emerson remember story get know keith emerson emerson lake palmer day keith use big moog impossible take tour need roadie full time keep go still moog able understand keith appreciate keith great user whether minimoog whatever able take knowledge engineering love music continuously refine process make machine sound great like think success well think tell difference fat synthesizer fat synthesizer mention name think ultimately one hmmm necessarily good thing say people drawn something different kind musical element even though machine mean clean without distortion mean maybe get right amount distortion one person taste maybe get lot distortion somebody taste hard explain term classic analog synthesizer sound moog able partially design love music understood music big analog synthesizer sound one bwwwoooooooow sound get bottom thing dy well maybe best want hear wall shake understood kind like element hip hop east coast west coast lot hat really wack competition even want give prop name well much think east coast west coast hip hop think year know synthesizer know love hand creative musician presume even bad synthesizer planet become effective tool still certain thing love way sound might love something completely different drove work hour day year year love every minute solder iron hand get think oooh look great circuit hear hear someone take great sound like make make music clasp chest still think different kind synthesizer make different sound classic period might say learn many case stuff lookedhear use newer music like stuff people make like oh realize could make great sound education admit love make synthesizer big fat sound happens happen like fortunately people planet happen like well fun part two hip hop analogy well place really tough competitor market place seem awful lot respect certain key player well well start synthesizer lates main competition well arp never really competitor time building oberheim stuff arp pretty much business still point time well one claim fame would first polyphonic synthesizer could buy music store fame couple year prophet come along pretty much almost put business push onto stuff day sequential circuit run guy name dave smith could sell everything could make could sell everything could make technically competitor ever problem thing roger linn good friend lm linndrum dmx could sell pretty much everything could build yes competitor like take sale away co exist know hip hop world coexistence work maybe friendly well close little hip hop trilogy guy meet nowadays thing call dead president society kind institution like back exist roger dave synthesizer business frantic race utilize late technology technology change fast look back really synthesizer business ten year look first synthesizer ten year later technologically different maybe meet trade show dinner together busy try next best thing make enough profit keep company go worry technology whatever time meet often social thing run scar u small company time look shoulder japan time japan get synthesizer business worried always run fast could lot time social thing japanese enter game bob despite respect different view polyphony oh yeah could first explain well synthesizer make monophonic could play one note could put five finger keyboard get one note one sound well could lot pitch still one note do experiment friend mine experimental composer los angelesreally fantastic keyboard improviser would improvise theme take audience first half concert second half would hook ring modulators revox tape recorder tape echo thing like live electronic music one concert brought two monophonic synthesizer built little circuit board within arpallowed play two key two pitch two voice two oscillator could played two pitch still go one filter one vca take twoone concert set could play simple four part bach type stuff even though extremely crude carefully set synthesizer sound like something pursue sound great hear polyphonic music synthesizer although really practical yet back mind lead year later true polyphonic synthesizer polyphony monophony one sentence ability play one note time four voice polyphonic synthesizer play four note whereas minimoog arp play one note difference think synthesizer stayed monophonic nearly interest world today least nevertheless could understand bob stance towards well way come synthesizer idea synthesizer could make complex sound could overdub add together like famous switch bach really put synthesizer map bob really concentrate early day make instrument musician go tour perform musician course say earlier enough resource could take big modular moog road roadie goal begin ring modulator phase shifter build equipment musician want tour equipment carry one place another lock studio could say ad take studio stage always think term well studio overdub like wendy carlos switch bach need polyphony overdubbing someone want play polyphonic synthesizer stuff tour overdub obviously guess favorite quote context god meant sing polyphony would give one voice guess give u one finger well late argue one thing give u next important topic design interface interface use keyboard interest thing invention synthesizer exclusively invention bob moog time bob invent synthesizer new york another engineer also see coffee thursday call buchla also invent synthesizer time bob moog know independent moog philosophy make could relate conventional musician point view black white regular conventional keyboard buchla believe still day much building synthesizer interfaced various kind touch keyboard non traditional controller idea way people go one direction go another direction thing see indicate slideshow ok oberheim four voice polyphonic synthesizer really put map way synth born developed little synthesizer module see four module machine idea module among thing fatten sound add sound say minimoog arp synth slightly different sound moog arp could parallel together could get slightly different sound originally module go module implement sound exist machine remember experiment friend several year concert kind crude polyphonic thing one day decide january get idea put four eight module together simple digital keyboard first polyphonic synthesizer module already existence make decision take six week design machine later thing would take year design one six week actually matter survival point time company chicago sell lot phase shifter ring modulators pedal time also one day january call say tom time bad business good cancel order sudden real business say well maybe time come polyphonic idea take module already put four together keyboard month later show namm show oberheim synthesizer world born kind desperation sometimes need push along go get do tomorrow well get do thing normally lot time guess would time probably listen something well little medley thing put together music pat metheny go music doobie brother fool believe music gary wright dream weaver music rush tom sawyer music stanley clarke strange weather music weather report birdland music van halen jump obviously time parent get machine guess none could mean many unit sell polyphonic stuff many day go rate else mean tr sit use music store whatever first track played medley pat metheny group popular jazz group existence almost year popular saw pat metheny year ago concert give fantastic concert people want say hello left wait around talk say know tom start group oberheim take last money paper round help pay oberheim think tell torsten knew tangerine dream early day bought oberheim early day oberheim polyphonic visit berlin many time would concert take every pfennig whatever put gear yes expensive else people found way sure find way something must course different mix like say mainly orient towards perform musician would play club go tour early day rich expensive find second generation use stuff like second hand market revive gear well general simple sense synthesizer world go analogearlybecame digitalize dx digital machine mainly japan kind kill analog think one time company make analog synths computer get powerful go plug in like different thread go along one come one go another one come along assume see dx know one first digital synthesizer real popular come scene explode five year later dead analog thing become popular lateearlydied thing come go thing get big die continual process time could buy oberheim well ebay could buy oberheim nothing could get four voice course little different think cycle probably another five year nobody want know continually cycle even cycle really depends mean might mean terribly different thing depend little example boy use oberheim local church really fat organ sound something quite different music x sonic destroyer guess get idea maybe necessarily design machine first place oh absolutely true first time heard track come today necessarily kind music listen day long love great suppose heard different context go around listen song think oh oberheim listen music listen music fact get oberheim great instrument make know process do whether pat metheny soft jazz almost symphonic way something like completely different genre feel say everything hear like every music agree think emotion built thing give musician want everyone go soft jazz thank goodness well pretty direct way guy influence kind heavily another artist strong relationship speaker hum think oberheim music stevie wonder village ghetto land ok let talk oberheim matter fact although oberheim story fact big monstrous lb yamaha machine call c think stevie wonder song key life time make album friend america producer write column magazine call mix ever read mix magazine ok record studio magazine friend write anyway knew stevie wonder well early day develop oberheim take studio hollywood stevie song key life met stevie coincidentally first prototype oberheim take studio stevie love hear c use later oberheim bought like wow first sale stevie wonder never hurt something like sure song use song key life sure use thanks torsten play connect c want carry c studio anything else weigh something like lb crazy machine two three ever make think thank two two well maybe make ten forget one monster interest ultimately studio know stevie ever say one engineer say stevie learnt oberheim get much well sound yamaha yamaha capability sound like encourage think first time saw word oberheim back stevie record popular record mother like much first sight turn around saw ooh different song flip side next song picture stevie sit castle keyboard middle yeah oberheim everything write braille oh yeah sure also good play paint panel learn word little mark fader type thing would feel mark would program see end look sound two guy also crazy electronic stuff always tend mix name lars sit audience bitte tonto expand head band oh yeah couple guy los angeles make monstrous analogue synthesizer name crazy guy bob margouleff producer early stevie wonder guy malcom cecil many different synthesizer thing call tonto expand head band arp little oberheim moogs big monstrous thing think take stevie studio though one move start sound like sort circuitry chef like kitchen hand people enjoy feast role people play middle well first let say day kind circuit design expert bob moog genius circuitry although people look fame invent synthesizer engineer point view circuitry admire say earlier work another engineer guy bode come original idea patch cord stuff moog filter love people talk minimoog filter start big moog modular bob invention transistor level genius oberheim consider great circuit guy help one case part oberheim module design engineer arp another design engineer e mu guy start e mu originally start company building modular synths invent sampler help invent sampler help spent time put module together make least partially playable human always easy awful lot thing even go near yet one thing definitely miss talk synths probably difference lot people know little thing well connects screen see dmx drum machine tell u learnt building synths implement drum machine well story guess dmx polyphonic synthesizer business three plus year someone mention guy name roger linn invent programmable drum machine wonder probably expose early day hammond organ make little box would play electronic tango crap really horrible stuff nothing ever want listen long heard programmable drum machine guy roger linn met thought well programmable make rhythm real drum sound genius idea turn roger la day la invite office day people really business roger rock roll guitar player idea talk say together make sell pay royalty say want start company want roger go start company linn electronics first product lm later linndrum thought well absolutely connects synthesizer synthesizer two go together come drum machine call dmx another situation roger could sell could make could sell could make technically competitor fight people like sound lm linndrum particular sound particular user interface people like lead another thing mention briefly long realize get synthesizer control ob x ob xa computer control programmable could store patch memory control computer design computer interface ob xa also hire young kid even finish high school give job design first polyphonic sequencer call dsx figure way hook together midi midi even invent yet call oberheim system synthesizer driven dsx sequencer sent clock dmx synchronize drum sequencer popular year two midi invent first midi understand midi sole invention either lot different people involve right well many people involve idea midi start dave smith founder sequential circuit prophet back business well idea call midi way hook synthesizer together use digital signal first present idea technical conference later expand start work roland really midi many people basically guy dave smith sequential roland work course midi everywhere really work couple engineer roland guy dave smith one engineer everywhere first wonder would work well year software engineer found way make work pretty well use lot dave another one good friend live san francisco coffee thursday life maybe two hour away see every talk old day talk happen people think coffee thing electronic music people talk electronic music talk get osx work program oh get work let call friend apple talk coffee talk synthesizer tackle differently sell machine contain handful sound instead machine give almost infinite possibility time dmx linndrum come market drum synthesizer couple company england one u successful think time whereas synthesizer programmed sound differently change thing people want real drum sound want real drum like say cater make instrument travel musician go philosophy tell drummer go hell although happen extent whatever reason people want real drum sound interested synthesize drum lot harder synthesize real powerful drum sound although doable tr prove sound tr record take lot work make sound good easy recording could play back fairlight entity understood fairlight sample begin big thing yet knew could basically market want real drum sound synthesize mindset little different listen track detroit guy mean drum make happen never heard think drum synthesizer stuff available power people want never become popular record sound people want least perceive time today nerd perspective absolutely fantastic thing need burn little chip change sound imagine time build thing would devastate well people make different drum chip time eventually make product oberheim could burn drum chip call prommer successful company sprung garage kind work little company could buy drum chip fact exactly digidesign start two guy garage building drum chip linndrums oberheim drum machine get idea hard disk record course digidesign monstrous do quite alright yeah do okay ever thought chipped give grant something well get drum chip business get record hard disk big step first successfully probably lot beat head probably run couple oberheim drum sound load recognize anywhere lionel richie run dmc back play selection oberheim drum sound play round spot drum anyone yell name thing play selection obviously really sad sample rendition another feel actual instrument hand hearing play seem little cleaner dmx little bit early early day sample circuitry necessary high quality sample expensive day cd digital record popular yet make fairly crude record dmx popular successful product obviously people like heard guess still use although eight nine month ago take dmx attic put trash thought never need brought could raffle could pretty nice auction guess company later one crucial point want touch upon open floor stage walk street shop saw oberheim product anymore lose name like lose child well slightly different emotion let first say ever actually walk music store see oberheim mine know talk metaphorical way might ask stop well much american story make brief essentially happen start company hire lawyer basic company stuff decide want make corporation lawyer stuff make corporation paperwork year go advice oberheim get big oberheim get trouble financially develop matrix big expensive machine do basically careful finance pretty much ran money go lawyer know year trust give advice first month lead push company edge bankruptcy oberheim make profit take profit use buy part matrix ran money course big mistake conservative matrix know ever see one big machine voice polyphonic etc etc anyway lawyer convince plan even though oberheim go continue way plan told follow plan bank oberheim owe money would probably shut oberheim also would take house thought happy wife go advice complicate legal thing involve lawyer stuff understand make lot sense make long story short end buying asset oberheim bank plan talk partner new company own asset oberheim never happen work year half also talk people oberheim also little work patent patent attorney help get patent go lunch one day told happen say screw like wow thought great guy never do course history end oberheim drain readily available money left oberheim give gibson future royalty oberheim name oberheim logo gibson own oberheim name sad story end oberheim nothing ob oh several thing make gibson also make viscount nothing far concerned oberheim product go found marion seasound probably lot interest people like ultimate scenario mistrust everything always fear like oh stinky lawyer call american story way europe everyone incredibly afraid ever go bankrupt ever otherwise immediately need commit harakiri style suicide whereas seem like happens lot find strength brush try well love think make point get rich thrill make instrument whether guy detroit eddie van halen whoever never met eddie van halen hear thrill see particular song whatever start new company built new synthesizer fast right success take retirement synthesizer business also business become uninteresting business become workstation japan interest start hearing bit piece new consider new look career engineering year electronic music year dj producer thing call new hearing start hear interest music course heard music knew name easy say jazz everybody know jazz easy say rock roll heavy metal whatever harder say people many little name stuff know enough music know difference bass drum next one still discover heard lot music lot synthesize love synthesize music yesterday joel played piece lp italian groupfantastic hear oberheim think say do oberheim even synthesizer oberheim love synthesize music many different state start problem fast go prove world could good job machine success thanks red bull really inspire see different way synthesize music go may know stand ovation good place end huh pretty sure awful lot question ask sure deal interim stand ovation sure do fine really feel lot question quite bit time oh yeah hope consider god afraid ask anything hope make point love whether home lab design circuit talk musician love feel free ask whatever want hi thanks share knowledge little question first polyphonic synthesizer wonder decide put four module together three five six reason first decide concept make expandable expensive could start four voice later expand six voice eight voice three versus five well always curious prophet come like five voice strange maybe five voice dunno case circuitry several level work pair another machine time four voice one call two voice two module basically engineering decision couple level thing work pair basically want make expandable person could buy four later expand thank hi wonder play keyboard instrumental performer performer house work something ever tempt play surround product make um reason way process start start work stuff start immediately meeting great musician like well play like herbie bother think much learn keyboard player composer band leader happy engineer hear people never really played mean always try change change circuitry think sound right play music couple boring announcement make absolutely say big thank share u mr tom oberheim please applause
