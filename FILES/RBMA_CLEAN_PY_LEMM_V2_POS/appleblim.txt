playstation stuff really matter long sound good sure people would argue go listen tune call girder second skull disco release music appleblim shackleton girder applause far production career make still pretty early day really probably second thing finish still lucky mixdown kind period really really know kind try best lot people sat couch talk talk start try make record like process seem quite common hear something like go home go wonder learn navigate whatever use case entirely yes directly inspire beat skream benga make back raw strip fact fruityloops heard read interview thought hmm think probably get listen something else early day early early day directly inspire something yes mean like digital mystikz first start get played fwd like massive massive influence sort try something bit like mixed big fan ed rush nico trace stuff like back get bit well music appleblim unknown think everyone kind heard say maybe kind say take tune way slightly rare record digital mystikz chainba really sort strange music youngsta hatcha first start play chainba kind like take bit take couple time stand almost get use dance way first heard jungle whatever think go move kind like bleep bass rhythmic diversity sort quite astound thought element favorite thing distil way heard want get involve mention metalheadz minute ago mala poke loefah go metalheadz know back come town call plymouth south west big rave scene move london listen radio stuff like mind blowing try find raf eventually find blue note hoxton square caught last couple follow around religiously next three four year really funny though remember mala say first guy metalheadz last leave queue like always guy reading time front u dude lot people seem first would word subsume like totally lose scene experience poorly put together sentence kind first musical epiphany around metalheadz guess may conversation think thing even kode well music hear make almost idea come jungle drum bass try make something mimic feel like feel ghost stuff space almost rhythm rather try fill ghost jungle ghost rave mention ed rush nico may mention optical sure u turn stuff particularly like raw energy basically see play day mad seem create track design mixed together seem know inside outside tune completely ed rush trace back back mix amen would fire one deck space would another one completely link reading studio stuff well nico whole kind someone would bring fresh tune mix another one mix make take get played even really really inspire really primal energy kind thing always good line title like soundboy ash get chopped snort keith richards story come think secret skull disco fan reckon rip u tell u bit aesthetic label obviously name label title artwork get record let get show around important whole thing massive really learnt lot really first couple release people talk artwork music really think probably high standard eventually start write stuff maybe stood basically shackleton come kind punk rock diy fanzine side thing always big visual thing friend use draw thing fanzines sort make sense start label get involve like one guy one shackleton old friend come visuals definitely taught something like something really nice faceless white label think term lot stuff use buy grime dubstep early day random pressing like white label never really knew definitely something sort good also identify something especially age downloads stuff like think give people product get something special really really important make sure finish skull disco next thing really want present different way still strong visual element think think people really cherish buy something skull disco lifetime really successful label yes yes unexpectedly think shackleton music carry though certain amount time distinctive different enough picked techno dj never expect happen start pitch put set stuff never expect anything try hard flog copy black market important record store soho london first release stuff people bit confuse like weird look like heavy metal record gradually become something successful anything ever intend ten release kind run course think try carry make work kind way right nice chance thing everything work try engineer think would work kind thing separately shack still make music go different kind thing tell u story get ricardo villalobos mix shackleton blood hand happen read magazine chart basically book bestival first time play well fan record never see dj miss become big dj still weird experimental techno producer really funny happens sometimes think someone one thing rest world caught fact something completely different totally totally go check really foresight think bring along part one tune play kind stood front shout notice u wear skull disco hoodies wave cd eventually kind look walk look say shackleton say nah nah put cd hand shout remix nod put bag thought last hear two week later get touch say do bonkers really know minute long tell make shorter want go change way welcome weird opportunity try edit massive minute tune really anything either say look let cut middle stick two side see happens basically save label struggle point put bed even break even give u remix without even talk money really like gift label go sell nearly copy vinyl shot arm u completely shack return favor remixing funny though often point view someone music go record shop see thing fully form entity imagine look skull disco record think well buy might struggle sense go behind scene quite interest see even people get label thing go trial tribulation anyone go also really love story fantastically democratic backstage hang literally front go look u shirt really genuine chap lot people sniff around heard remix want release really adamant like label anything else want carry help way good shackleton kind really use word publicly unkeen public seem extreme discomfort around word dubstep connotation dubstep think response kind far end spectrum reflect people within scene yeah sure mean way sort market label something explore dubstep grime bass music time correct kind thing think become whole dubstep think shack really lose interest year incredible record digital mystikz skream benga stuff like move thing felt like kind carry along stuff yeah think kind guy attention part kind scene people say remix meeting techno dubstep like really clue stuff hugely dubstep time know lot techno know kind like something kind happen think would prefer sit home make music put whoever buy buy whereas lot whole process promote record read magazine obsessively like know people play work two different way work really think probably right time u go separate way thing feel internationalization expansion kind unwieldy thing call dubstep good know know go hear big tune get played inspire much hearing really weird fringe stuff long people happy dance anything people say drum bass dead longer experimental whatever surely need find people still rave good time want basically different energy dubstep club say year ago month ago although say say different energy day developed feel difference first start go fwd less people rave dance kind people stood listen cool kind move music would go crazy say mean crew people shack friend really nice know people kind appreciate sort like oh yeah remember come go mental dmz eventually kind ask u play stuff direct thing kind inspire enthusiastic music think kind energetic response music really really important think danger become bit macho big build drop stuff like people big kind mosh push around aggression side
