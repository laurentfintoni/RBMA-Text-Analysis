disco sleeve inner sleeve gesture record sleeve manual packaging come machine sleeve manual packaging people stand high table hand glove process get drawn manual packaging pay five cent four cent paper bag already nine cent extra cost disco sleeve check course use standard sleeve one cyk four color need four film sent printer would need least sleeve vinyl get damage transport press plant manual packaging something happen copy expensive sleeve make new label shy away fancy artwork expensive need keep cost someone start would tell course unless lot money count calculate really tight people love care want fancy sleeve even copy stop someone make track think go next big thing want press would sit listen say go repress something would discus distributor label day press batch press
