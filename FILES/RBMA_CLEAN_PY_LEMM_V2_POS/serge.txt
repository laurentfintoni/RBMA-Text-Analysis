original ur release ur release like magical record u whole concept whole artwork thing whole story around music also master ron murphy get like certain aesthetic get certain vision master well thought well cannot compete compare bring another context make whole new playlist make four different release whole collection music get remastered also want people hear part hear original release least master different way could listen probably way heard studio make could hear studio make ron murphy vision little bit want new master want present say certain thing drexciya track heard specifically mean could give u example ron murphy work may change sure think would great could give u example go change someone record quite fundamental thing bring certain thing form tone certain thing yeah also thing master detroit ron murphy master thing could play loud thing certain wow edge also mean part charm well since reissue thought ok make sound like make sound sound studio try make sound properly include low end mid freq mid thing normally get like press together could hear couple part know small frequency thing hidden ron murphy master version alden tyrell good job think put lot time especially alden tyrell put lot time master lot work original tape multi track well end full catalog reissue new sound quality feel sense responsibility remastered work feel even able get hand tape something fundamentally make sense well make couple choice try felt best u also discus couple people involve thought reissue original ur release original version original track listing try try create different way listen drexciya keep original one original one intact record touch want touch like prop go kudos go mike bank also guy make music try create new context well new context think people buy clone record physically want old record also self always look like would like see would like want listen drexciya different way mean otherwise would play original record want different way also could
