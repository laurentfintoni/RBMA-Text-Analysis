hi chris four thing first foremost master engineer mean basically spending day night studio healthy studio tan secondly producer thirdly dj fourthly edit magazine music maker magazine pas around guy look basically work industry year ok yeah old start live sound work rig stuff lot band come crowd house depeche mode omd front house mix help rig stuff learn basically work obligatory cheap black shirt black trouser yeah work hour non stop beach one day decide loud sound anymore get studio work start edit luckily miss tape edit stage thank god ever edit tape complete joke ever want trust get ta make work copy do start edit make mistake get go next copy cut quite mission afterwards get run whole lot another tape add lot noise well good noise smile ironically first start kind system use first start edit small mac first sound tool baby brother protools protools come basic bit two channel edit program much else besides rudimentary eq couple crappy compressor lot processing do analog domain well still best way eq wise think yes absolutely eq wise mean term processing much well digitally eq ing analog still definitely well brought example track unmastered track master give well idea difference session practical actually take track guy do master give well idea exactly go get finalizer unit design master get whole master chain inside go show exactly everything software people thought bring along show guy easy way demo master many guy actually put record look around participant kind process guy master process basically entail two thing firstly eq balance track throughout frequency spectrum audible inaudible get balance sound first part relative every time change one thing whole mix change like continuous refining get right sound second dynamic part may know louder well people see world always true usually sound louder well dynamic part perceives dynamic well actual dynamic range go finalizer nice way demonstrate demo get well basically try master engineer get hot possible get balance possible onto digital format record onto analog format without perceivably change mix mean guy go spend like three week mix track wannago change sound two three hour master get ta try get want without change sound perceivably trick ear believe sound exactly basically idea let play guy track give sort reference come play unmastered version first go master version give background music unmastered house track bass quite floppy bottom end lot frequency really mix much good gonna give master version see think music master version track clarity becomes lot well becomes lot louder lot tighter hear let ask question premastered version person mixed obviously think mix right yeah create kind feel insecurity know master mix track think best ability three engineer whole world get eqed go mastering everyone get eqed master engineer eq everything trust particpants marianne david touch yesterday guy studio keep dynamic fairly open mix quite true dynamic actual mix master harder push compress harder job remember guy lay mix lay compress want lay dynamic even lay different format dat cd go sound well use one ok gonna play example music unmastered house track basically want want mix change much hear mix still fairly similar mean lot thing actually change perceivably still fairly similar heard less hear difference well actually long louder kick laugh participant track multi band eq combination yes use mixture multi band limiter mean know guy work channel splitter live split bass mids high separate signal feed different amp play sound basically do originally master would split low mids high compress separately set different attack high lot quicker set low attack bottom lot slow basically creates much tighter mix lot louder mix well also allow eq three separately well finalizer get three band compressor limiter already split automatically adjust show guy practical bit later would say master music genre specific example imagine would master rock record way would master reggae record also audience look different thing well like r b record guy look hell bass response get much wider bass range use r b would use house rock rock quite thin actually master yes definitely genre specific term dance music even specific thing like certain breakbeat style would like lot bass heavy example drum bass yeah drum bass even prodigy stuff breakbeat stuff whereas house producer would try pull back little bottom end get punch yeah genre specific absolutely bad master experience many mention country official language lot master do past would get sent unmarked tape nothing basically track listing record company put two together try work song try pick lyric work try go find someone actually speaks language come help also actual mix get past horrific mean like hz hum come whole mix noise like shhhshshshshsh whistle loud character think mean noise like characteristic noise dr moog agrees characteristic electronic noise great mean add flavor song general tape hiss cool bad wiring contributes well guy know difference balance signal unbalanced signal cable shield cover wire signal go hot signal two core cable shield use signal well negative ground run shield noise sort light cable electrical noise get picked cable transfer sound basically pick noise everywhere happens balance cable three core get shield two cable well ground take away noise protects signal anytime get opportunity use balance signal rather use balance unbalanced much cleaner much hotter well play much louder balance signal bit trivia information music yeah get couple play music unmastered track master version blank cd difference brand one unbranded process essentially necessarily mean get unbranded cd pretty good well mean use specific brand cd cd press plant stuff get press less trouble brand brand use specific brand think gonna make difference much mean certain sort taiwanese various sort cheap copy really bad use master get stage cd r useable actual laser write burning onto cd gonna get error get transfer somewhere along line get bit back personal production stuff make music home also make demo home also produce record master home studio necessarily thing think actually produce record mix record get best advice engineer call jay mixed prince black album come mix miriam makeba album studio use work high profile studio lion king ii soundtrack lion king iii soundtrack stuff disney high profile studio johannesburg probably high profile studio johannesburg call csr basically get input euphonix mix console get two studio high end digital mix capability run protools high density khz sample system back guy mixed black album yeah advice give probably best heard put mixdown soft volume level hear quite soft soft hear hear everything balance listen way hear everything cleanly balance mix right basically master dynamic range get master engineer hell lot work something like fairly open get lot dynamic producer allow space mean mix might use finalizer might use multi band compressor group insert would rather like marianne davis say last night rather individual thing like kick drum bass would say yes go ahead final mix also good idea master stuff generally say guy get friend stuff sort master stuff give track master master track lose objectivity work track long get assistant work mixed track write often master get objective ear term like listen five million time know anymore bit good advice idea different pass mix well yeah still school especially state different mix every different format tv video cd even advert different way mixed vocal track always lay vocal mix instrumental ever go back remix capella yeah many different mix want take master engineer choose best one charge well yeah mean find reasonable master guy expensive sure like say get friend thing give track go go much well way think see day job becomes irrelevant think always need human element transfer format basically sort facilitate transfer one format another always think need
