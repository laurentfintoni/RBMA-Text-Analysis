organic sound reminiscentamazing bandwidth technology pretty much concept make sound even fatter automation super bandwidth cd bass even incredible mix tweaked eddie kramer technology back day even imagine stuff would sound spoil automate every single thing make perfect right think whole album live live yes record tape every last bit record tape yes applause five year make three year altogether electric lady studio expensive enough tape pretty expensive yeah end use reel tape erase anything need space would make copy one track reel store reel song five reel three would vocal take heard story start lay track album cover marvin album prince album true yeah think spirit album like jam spawn song part whole vibe album would go jam stevie cover three hour idea would come within hour would something would press record tape presumably jam still exist tape somewhere yeah probably song altogether laugh see box set alternate song lose angelo tape work tape use digital audio three song go protools edit really long mistake want preserve live performance try redo take musician feel go protools even angelo pretty much brainwash believe protools best great edit still think sound suffers get well come close tape ever point go protools avoid cost avoid much possible still everything tape mix tape well record many layer track like root must different voice actually probably like would triple note four part overlap part overlap track per part overlap another track record tape move anything every time record live make even phenomenal yeah every single thing record live copying paste shall check think probably relevant track term talk layer vocal track call root yes think sorry vinyl bit mash played one time music angelo root thank unbelievable laugh really great tune vocal

drum anything particular approach record want mention come mic ing particular approach least half drummer drummer get good sound make job much easy approach get good amount whole frequency spectrum drum go hz way far hear drum voice probably wide frequency spectrum try capture whole sound individual drum stay room stand five foot away walk around see whole thing place mics accordingly sort similar set time depend drummer room move different room mics around overall drum sound end track mix combination separate mics overhead room sound try capture air feel front kit many mics average use kit average probably eight two snare two kick single mic tom usually use single overhead well many people stereo overhead unless huge piece kit use single microphone top record equipment talk u electric lady studio significant record funny go visit angelo richmond start album talk visualise conceptualise time turn jimi hendrix heard purple haze fire played hendrix freak holy shit hero influence hendrix never knew year huge prince fan prince hendrix whole stage persona hendrix played album do electric lady like stevie wonder lead zeppelin album say go record mean still around go see

everything zero get feel already start mix record mind definitely feel track think would difficult keep bring rough mix home take get use hearing super raw form say keep rawness really eq want someone found cassette tape obscure band really old still play hiss like old demo tape someone lose vibe want create subliminally little scatter reason long mix take mix two week angelo perfectionist two week three four day even listen left like ok great experiment like ok let put bed lose perspective hardest part end keep perspective head ready move forward old love ready move hardest part last part mix process maintain talk track untitled feel mention prince hendrix influence definitely hear one funny every song think story untitled already past ten deadline two year later walk say want cut new song

good song waste time wonder everyone download want spend cash two song album worth complete garbage applause favourite lp time term sound well content definitely jimi hendrix album definitely big influence grow play guitar way record would make feel beatles record even day still pick like holy shit realize compress drum part stevie wonder album raw quality everything sound like room close eye feel like drummer sit right vocal horn big pink floyd fan talk record general think mix sound perspective guess overall experience definitely dark side moon awesome top bottom grow new york radio station would play perfect album side every thursday people would call request perfect album side one would abbey road another great one top bottom want take needle record turn depress put work hear mp gotten use help anymore shame substandard become standard people prefer necessity ipod get little ipod shuffle put song cool people really care anymore kind sad one guy try keep alive compare something analog something do entirely digital comparison hand compare even play wav aif computer cd could hear difference two yeah converter people realize take care every aspect process go show end skip process cheat middle go show say use great mic vocalist rush take care particular thing could use tape day easy use protools careful whole process take time go show end project like wow glad like record sound like listen ipod put aif wav yeah laugh fact get first ipod year take ten year even get cd player house much huge analog fan mix perspective important know sound like go know go like old day people use listen crappy speaker knew would sound like radio consideration know people listen crap mp consider though listen computer especially studio say go europe mix project foreign studio listen many different system try play club car shittiest speaker find pretty much standard get able play anywhere every time mix take home play car two three time come next day lot dj collector transfer digital may start like purist think everything get aif wav cd quality whatever realize go put music collection go need nasa level storage get take pepsi challenge mp aif average person never get still quite upset hear music compress even level right use get use really bother anymore mix do well get level hear really pay attention would rather hear music played vinyl cd vinyl get good system one reason people home really need good turntable good system cd get away small system still make sound loud bass prefer vinyl listen cd go anywhere near computer printing everything tape everything analog people basic set ups home neve record desk home access ssl mix console step take ensure record good quality vocal bedroom situation nice quality guitar part look budget really start good microphone good mic preamp buy neve console buy really high quality mic preamp look quality major budget save really good microphone least medium level one buy box wait little bit save money next level far record protools thing use high quality converter know really expensive medium quality converter affordable day definitely stay away one box good start tweak sound depends perceive sound approach music use limited ear definitely crappy system make everything sound like crap stay away test everything buy listen word mouth get around really high quality gear find load studio around world closing around yes pretty much dry unfortunately protools revolution start intern back people still come demo people would cut deal manager want cut demo price x amount day would end work studio manager look get sign would album people demo house fine evolution production whole thing people home record label want spend money anymore budget go way everything protools cut album x amount money kill studio business studio closing one use reel tape home engineer maintain standard care fortunately people ask format want people want work know go mix album make sure record well possible spoil important master final mix album percentage depends get someone mix really suck master person save push frequency miss delete master engineer save lot time people come protools file stem kind remixing album master master go two day level everything separate drum bass vocal make final decision master mix really good master ice get level cd level want talk artist work year want talk angelo kid know

analog world definitely process longer apprentice special craft craft really start die come hopefully inspire people keep alive get plugins make sound like really try research sound sound new old sound come earlier engineer experiment tape everything tape base effect delay manipulate sound delayed create phase flanging double delay people learn certain standard one point come substandard many studio yeah want unfortunately many studio learn everything intern assist take six year go freelance engineer transitional phase work anybody get point could work well artist experience year certain amount time pick something substitute experience try either apprenticeship engineer work major studio around environment learn lot stuff assist learn craft basic microphone placement mic use studio etiquette vibe treat artist best possible get best possible performance lot people learn day craft craft anymore hopefully come back teach offer chance teach stuff berklee college music probably go pas completely dy go around little yeah hopefully get direct one one tuition studio definitely talk record talk different scenario ever record choir orchestra well record choir many orchestra think

sign label paris track nine kind like wacky song drum change different time music keziah jones kilo keziah jones right yeah question thanks amaze track interest lecture design stereo unit draw map something idea everything really plan start feel mix progress sometimes start maybe guitar one side end wind middle wherever feel time approach rhythm section side really big try make everything separate approach try make close eye people picture musician room thanks train ear closing eye listen always love thing sound always one get somebody house would eq system tune car stereo always like teenage year would lock room smoke pot listen music would pull bunch album sit hour listen ok yeah one question someone come asks certain sound like get natural drum sound something refer many start point drummer example natural sound one hear drummer seat someone audience sound hear pa question reference yeah really something hear head sometimes band rehearse immediately click go something time develops drummer usually feed sound give becomes sort like relationship happens yeah okay yeah thanks work atlantic record producer tom dowd wish really wish guy amaze man true innovator definitely one hero production record production yeah guy like beatles producer george martin far engineer bumped george martin one day kind freak would say big engineer producer work would probably bob stone queen stuff work kind eddie kramer guy michael barbiero probably would die chance work george martin tom dowd also involve master well sit master session yes absolutely especially entire album easy enough someone know vision begin tweak ear yeah definitely make sure master case touch much time get master really know heard couple system know tweak know really push bass bottom stuff play really tight right maxing onto tape yeah come master do master come mix yeah bottom cool man cheer thanks tip properly mic ing piano good tube mics really shine piano get away neumann condenser really best sound get use tube mics like neumann u c stereo mics many mics generally use two usually either go stereo mic x talk question two second ago want ask spend life car listen music try get mix right wonder exact difference track master achieve song come master surprised say guy still tweak song protools go conception people still send tape master even though never see tape life laugh bring final product difference know master studio proper step look totally different mix studio exactly do time get master level master mix quite loud cd one part part do everything put ice quality good properly engineer mixed general level track mixed general level master mix mixed half inch go basically little bit fine tune brighten put little bit top bottom thanks come share information u get question let say mix tune go put cd say drum bass tune go played proper dub reggae soundsystem bassline detuned sine wave bassline around hz would high pas bassline around hz would need sure sometimes surprised actually take bass create bass far mix aspect frequency call mask explain time technical level aurally listen get ear create illusion phase different frequency clash together actually phase create dead space frequency jump pull frequency create room actually push bass thanks get view boost eq mix boost yeah yeah know really rule need push get certain effect feel good mean push lot eq day mean yeah totally drastic eq ing yeah boost eq people say stay away oh either additive subtractive eq ing yeah like add certain frequency vocal kick drum something oppose cut frequency certain sound yeah kind go career kind start either cut boost see one work best also say go master tune cd played club process would go software people access hardware process would go term master like step eq compression limiter type thing analog gear yeah sure never way even tell plugins use use fair enough sorry fine advice write sound system write mono advice sorry say write tune specifically sound system write mono advice try mix mono one speaker mean yeah write tune mono know go play certain club club like sound system run mono ok yeah advice write tune mono purpose good mix quite bit mono certain point use call r tone kind like three inch speaker like cube go lot get level low really crank hear fact thing like harmony become clearer get minimum level right thanks lot thank hey say played guitar musician interest musician help get journey epic mix think definitely help sort musical background obviously go help want specifically engineer producer definitely think help relate artist try get sound across try explain even help session move little well far know different section go come vocalist could room horn player may able hear key really musician might able hear person thing like definitely help session technical level say musician cool exact difference engineer producer suggest idea person record producer role technically guess back day producer kind director basically point people right direction steer along try get emotion kind directs whole band engineer would technical guy look engineer like cinematographer producer director traditional role producer sort like songwriter engineer role guess always remain producer seem person directs whole thing kind like song writer least r b pop music one question put stuff vinyl send tape record vinyl tape digital format time analog wait sorry say put stuff vinyl send tape record vinyl good question vinyl could call transfer really vinyl master anymore still come digital master cd transfer onto lathe true true analog master huge process people still really want day like huge calibration everything cd get store back time people need machine get proper analog master cost lot money lot time yeah use digital master make vinyl copy basically maintain analog format time yeah exactly friend tell post forum sound technique address gearslutz com get home page scroll bottom link archive guest spot think call ok cool also curiosity remember sleeve note voodoo refer rus dragon get tattoo well actually get dragon tattoo get tattoo together time manager saw like oh go call dragon funny say do want credit proper russell elevado know proud want nickname attach know proper put anyway really piss first become thing like ok whatever people ask want dragon want say decide care fit thanks whole experience like ask use sort digital instrument setup never sometimes depends session like synthesizer stuff yes sometimes lot time artist come thing anyway bring analog keyboard stuff see digital piece go get prefer analog use make sound really good something touch certain mics get lot live musician get vocalist horn player would good could expand know neumann good say instance vocal get percussion get would good could expand mics company could go let see neumann make tlm km series excellent mics budget save know lot money people start go sorry go like wow get really great mic go good budget mic would audio technica make really good mics money entry level neumann mics really good money one company remember name would stay away even shure mic still use regularly drum never normally go tom snare always use sn like little thing like would definitely cruise forum check gearslutz research go blindly guitar center buy late great thing would definitely research find good detail ebay try look person ask oh laugh definitely research thank much really great day amaze stuff question interest particularly gospel track density voice number different voice tip density management tough one something learn mix year lot blend spend lot time blending particular section mostly start instrument get track know face ton vocal get track kind happen way put vocal right away instead wait step step process frequency know go lot work right away track never good stay solo mode hear instrument go sound completely different track solo hearing problem search different frequency time eqing everything track play together vocal spend time minute little ride level instead one level set take every note harmony move thing around sit perfectly lot placement spend lot time put sound field instead spread choir bass middle choir high right side spread thanks lot do recording outside studio live record different studio like field recording like musical cinema whatever sure knowledge quite difference proper instrument microphone rather shotgun microphone limited experience get start friend would experiment professionally do though do lot live recording reference people research film guy one go get foley exactly read guy get good information look thing film guy something love mix sound film question many people want study engineering audience raise hand camera many people musician last thing many people want go production absolutely fascinate lecture thank much share
