parentsalso siel synth think gear also friend think maybe bit money little electronic music studio basement like built around commodore four track stuff remember first acid house record actually yeah bought oppose hearing radio yeah first record compilation call house hallucinates like british compilation stuff chicago track really remember mean cassette bought vinyl like year ago track really remember time lidell townsell acid turn mostly like vocal like like world world happen go like flail beat even track like strange synth pattern like think lyric flail lidell like world go happen want go world want world start acid house crew call acid baron make shirt good name yeah thanks like cut manila folder parent around file like make stencil spray painting acid baron shirt still shirt wish wish make tape tape know probably go like discogs somewhere yeah like would take boombox two deck record one deck deck know talk sort popular thing radio two cassette deck one deck play deck record record first deck second deck want copy tape kind figure technique make loop put record pause second deck play first one right loop want un pause loop come pause pause tape mix yeah take like kraftwerk record like tangerine dream record four minute try get drum machine sync sometimes work well go take phone hook like landline hook one part house put mic part house talk phone sound like technological sound like sample try make sound like sample laugh well talk bard let talk hut yes think important connects skater talk well totally yeah well skate hut place actually know much must legal venue huge skate ramp imagine although providence time inconceivable somebody would built bunch skate ramp abandon building nobody care mean olneyville think become quite popularkind load record scene start really get attention providence olneyville neighborhood providence lot industrial production latelot big mill building stuff like many american city economy collapse lot abandon building lot crime lot mob activity lot super corrupt police activity stuffolneyville like real open area place monetize way nobody pay attention place probably police go go illegal thing police presence like gentrification type carceral model mean place cop go get hot dog stuff place nobody watch possible maybe even illegal must think degree legal venue like indoor skate park kind big skate ramp definitely always music play think sometimes band play stuff also become like hang think time even really skate anymore also super intimidate way pro skater own think own ran whatever intimidate go try go skate become cool hang like sort drift go oh cool let go skate hut place think could drink probably nobody watch monetize nobody watch cool teenager could lot thing old people go club still card club like sort club club something part skate hut yeah like scene open late night always people like one thing go two people meet ten hang industrial building olneyville point wish could remember somebody figure basement empty nobody anything whoever own skate hut lease building like let start club basement know person charge sort group people remember seem like kind naturally grow scene people hang become think kind collectively run certainly say actually part run felt like involve watch happen knew band played punk band played open cool band town remember first show rock construction building like pile rock like people sit pile rock watch punk band play really become thing quickly take least every weekend punk show could go nobody card security really compelling feel part think sort around time abc rio scene happen new york lot band come also bring energy activism lot anarchist lot radical politics lot think punk scene context radical politics like music fun way get aggression genuine test ground new social model place could talk thing felt like ethos really stuck since definitely yeah sure yeah mean become context lot way idea music part social whole people able connect meaningful way develop new idea live happen simultaneously experience happen also sort one thing really know teenager fail school cut school time drug hang like super shady people get bully bully get jumped beaten lot around ton violence sure happen basically decision parent go go art school cousin actually go take cello lesson kid study classical music never good honest never grabbed visual art become thing go go study accepted interest thing like simultaneously pretty profound experience get providence scene experience depth also sort prepare leave college like last two year high school move providence think lot kind start ask like shift hang listen late night radio go punk club hang street think seriously music composition art academic way like sort combine environment pretty like kind head fuck still unravel mean kind become think life work try least think also world negotiate dynamic meaningful way intelligence lot class think like people academia really smart street kid really dumb experience lot way honestly quite often opposite lot kid grow sex worker stuff mental institution know deep thinker really powerful meaningful idea creativity world dad academic like discover academia go college certainly aware also found people talk lot shit educational experience one tremendous frustration mean art obviously excite dynamic experience study painting without real formal background study musical composition without real formal background come level insistent aesthetic concern also old enough little old shape people like oh wow like really try obviously go let talk figure like graffiti stuff like paint like graffiti mean cool teacher cool get expose abstract expressionism like well seem like kind something might messy kind punk lot navigate dynamic also feel like experience sort involve kind counterculture whatever actually power think degree almost illusion create small providence could actually club talk political stuff make thing happen feel like big compare size city big lot thing interest thing still stuff unpack kind crystallize around begin expose found really interest idea particularly radical idea structure creative art possible reimagine structure reimagine musical creative structure extension reimagine political structure social structure dive deeply creative art theory around creative art one could start shape really radical model society could change human being could interact stuff kind bumping thing felt important like yes real thing like people room talk actually penetrate people actual life one way connect spirituality feel like way art spiritual spirituality radical kind create constellation meaning intense thing period academic study easy really fraught academic study increase reflection spirituality manifest music make time start make move bard towards new york city move new york cityjanuary manifest music make time mostly think bard manifest really slow really start make long composition much would happen start move idea improvise idea compose time really subtle difference describe difference main difference depth listen think improvise expressive act shift idea compose time meant much expressive reflective time might sit piano let say minute play maybe amount note start notice thing approach thing idea compose time would like improvisation maybe bit exploratory love improvisation super important distinction time important shift story think either thing definition thought like certain thing would sort compose time develop kind structure sound impetus like let try something feel really outside try note change completely like would break pattern cool thing pretty psychedelic thing realize create pattern note structure choose break pattern note structure choose actually create big structure pattern come later think kind distinction thing start build musical structure time become kind practice bard also music also space visual object thing get really excite create environment create music put environment actually composition program collapse semester amaze would say kind people experience go back providence summer start go ton newer underground illegal club kind focus around like much connect risd rhode island school design art school punk stuff happen also performative band would always costume much connect noise scene cool thing go back drop straight scene happen like oh shit people experimental music club kind punk people dance super excite go back little bit like go work mean also play band bard like thing come together suddenly composition program longer exist remove course curriculum put professor permanent sabbatical think thing right left college everything kind fell apart also get new influx stuff already go new york lot kind like ramp move new york really whim chance one woman art faculty bard even teacher always like come hang studio like move new york like ok like friend sublet apartment take go move new york lead like suddenly like go place whole relationship music quiet introspective reflective slow really good really good clean house really open thing suddenly stuff start come play music make time new york totally talk influence yes sound great project call paper eye recently reissue song call synthesis energy good one music paper eye synthesis energy applause paper eye synthesis energy reason want play feel like hear many different element music assume might listen time new york sort funky noise influence mention sound like something dance music someone would play noise event talk little bit time new york era obviously spoken lot think perspective really valuable reframing actually like work musician city time yeah totally remember want read quote person study composition bard think good lead come go name benjamin boretz would say pretty typical indicator stuff talk every day six eight hour class tell spiritual cannibalism culture culture bombarding u ultra sensory overstimulation aim reprocess u full time consumption machine steal u time inch time without imprint message even sense time measure length one message unit guise entertainment even art commoditizing eternal hype primal time sine qua non identity need take extreme measure reclaim super radical still really like resonant statement gotten bad since write wrotepretty also foreshadow meant lot idea even specific thing like way time steal u way music provide opportunity particularly music kind creative structure especially music provide opportunity reclaim one time radical actually inherently political thing like make music work time time time time somebody else time deep idea also lot kid earlycoming go towards new york go everything sense marketplace kind mindset absorb new thing hearing music hearing around sense want reclaim time contribute time people spending way connect start build synthesizer sort make decision go make music go make music term thing construct yeah think something even realize anomalous time maybe anomalous time also think lot people maybe also create mean production music come idea like make let see let think think one important insight get study music academic level idea default music go baseline music think mostly trace back woman susan mcclary like theorist musicologist always social political agenda embed every choice manifest music think professor add composer one try much possible start scratch degree one pick somebody else left degree implicitly endorse agenda example easy study eurocentric western classical tradition pick tradition mean also pick politics time class dynamic time pick like slavery pick colonialism pick stuff say oh well yeah like know like way stuff sound way stuff sound least idea meaningful degree felt like necessary much start scratch could meant create music also create methodology music make example paper eye thing track make music create technique make music like yes cassette deck reel reel obviously piece technology exist record way music make something developed take piece gear use unconventional way use record technique developed want create certain sound necessity like oh want make multi track record multi track recorder play old record back room record play new thing live lot available without even realize become critical creative practice make music also make mean make music get hand synthesizer easy way easy way learn electronics engineering learn build one feel look like tool would help make kind sound felt like kind sound want make sound like felt meaningful also bring back think maybe start go lot different kind club hearing lot different kind music dance also part constellation well meaningful think important kind culture want live kind world want live music make reflect something physicality way space people especially space marginal space kind music especially music certain kind kind social interaction possible possible circumstance make also want make music somebody could dance want bring sort like kind wide abstract compositional idea music would also operate physical level could dance lot happen new york like go different place go place like like alone rave type event kind happen something observe participate would say go place soak different kind thing place clearly define kind thing like talk earlier suddenly discover like oh right like like oh like techno place everybody dj play techno everybody come want hear techno like foreign idea meaningful nightlife space lack definition lack transparency actually happen like ambiguous opaque experience people interact explore thing also time new york though sort fall label particular label collective people music first put label dfa different everything release time time talk day mar record particular want play something need get record hop could tell everyone little bit delia gonzalez first felt sort part group simultaneously part group despite fact become associate period time yeah one many scene kind hang new york midkind like think bunch art school kid different city kind move new york sort beginning gentrification honest feel like lot work around gentrification definitely know contribute time life well begin williamsburg become place artist hang become lot like know punk also way fun super aggro like punk one people connect scene woman delia gonzalez miami work thought really cool fun kind party scene party illegal venue people would put play puppet show dance performance delia dance company later black leotard front dance company together kind grow kind met hit sort ambiguous way get together start make work together initially kind grow scene time also art world kind discover scene little bit interest overlap art world punk thing specific say scene people label talk nothing mean thing come scene fischerspooner thing actually think go somewhere fischerspooner far could tell thing one many thing time band call sweet thunder woman kelly kuvo band call scissor girl chicago super super important influential band kind geeked get play band brought people knew chicago one casey spooner think kind introduction music grow fischerspooner lizzie early fischerspooner record also band sort start venture try make new york city artist lot different thing one thing start make electronic music together synths built like classic new york broke artist like go get job like whole long story happy tell want told many time get hire dfa long story short email bunch label say could fix synths james murphy one respond one write back like three minute sent email must lot broke synths like synths bought ebay none work please please please come fix stuff dfa job get hire like studio tech dfa also lot building stuff would like first thing ever get hire dfa james like think like make track kind seem like catch ever intend actually play live project look like gonna play song live know make crappy old casio boombox could build kind like super casio super tough could take tour everything lose edge time song thought catch little bit become think caught yeah think caught place time space kind thing would lot time synth something cool build mod something lot stuff interested time try get ambient sound sync rhythmic sound interest way use analog synthesis really alley think especially lot remixes hear technology built dfa remixes time job point james tim jon time label james murphy tim goldsworthy jonathan galkin three dude run label jon tim come screen delia played live soundtrack time seem like like cool like want put record journey described come way know dfa know scene lot thing new york know come outside place time basically hung one person like delia hung sometimes dance performance guy come different world like world reading book witchcraft house building synthesizer sink thing like oh people label seem kind cool want put record later understood part building story label able say even role played artist label even psychedelic electronic music use build know dfa aesthetic punk funk james call synthesizer bass real drum something like strong aesthetic dfa sound like different sort use build story set dfa even apart label time kind like like show work sometimes james would tour get work studio sometimes britney spear duran duran would show studio cause dfa cool hot label britney spear yeah point maybe go produce record yeah spent two day studio actually notebook brainstorming lyric take tech notebook brainstorm lyric legal pad tech notebook still let listen day mar think production question go bring afterwards relevee delia gonzalez gavin russom day mar music delia gonzalez gavin russom rise applause think worth mention minute long almost like minute long think full hour play album really would rise think interest point make album song originally go play relevee also like minute minute kosmiche track take entirely new second life carl craig remixed become popular dancefloor track sven väth compilation cd played love parade year come laugh think interest thing track relationship see album mention dfa use sort punky dance thing serious music cross boundary become fun club thing curious hear take general think music nowadays traverse serious fun boundary general musician transcend sort think make think like fun serious fun serious thought would interest jumping point talk yeah absolutely sure dynamic certainly play even time come realize time radical way thing two lp double lp four song one around minute long come label time pretty much famous house jealous lover rapture lose edge lcd soundsystem really like kind operating world already like yeah super serious music also really like go club think partly tim goldsworthy really work lot record recently found demo tape record wild hear difference delia demo like versus happen think lot tim british scene kind talk acid house lot process work record kind remember reawaken teenage interest love music start get record pretty much also djed start play acid house time time also think interest dance delia also chris visual artist hang go harlem go vogue ball still best know complex way culture appropriate last know ten year make reluctant talk queer kid try figure somebody value deep complex art also deep complex art actually connects daily life powerful thing spend time guest scene time madonna co opt vogue current wave also nobody watch really interest think yeah idea serious fun would say one thing dedicate life try find way living outside kind binary one work long time dichotomize super significant think polar opposite like oh serious music fun music work well really work find different way think even idea listen music dance music little bit weird always thing engage music think thing become important think become thing way environment like club dance sort default ritual behavior let hope good night like bunch terrible dude try make girl feel uncomfortable provide opportunity engage music way shift away commodity market towards something physically experienced experienced physically enters whole cognitive apparatus human organism different way think little bit significant way like relationship music ear brain lose much spectrum matter kind music even record think hop time would part asset release dance level think maybe become part liability release dance label thought also dance music music speaks body think emerge context drum beat driven drum beat driven none track beat record know come across oh eno like tangerine dream ambient music thought really physical think fact set broadly apart thing like eno tangerine dream stuff also feminist music intentionally come really different place think male dominate history electronic music definition feminist music think feminism broad define always go back quote angela davis lecture give call abolition feminism talk feminism ability make connection thing patriarchal culture seem connect discover thing assume connect patriarchal culture actually connect good definition mine somebody do lot work sense categorization music something producer composer technique actively work impend categorization process composition motivation put name thing time assume sort strategy whether philosophical even technical accumulate year would hope pre empt way yeah unrelentingly complex authentic think best one easy think also spiritual thing come market extremely allure market current state thrives categorization sort work categorization large part something come enlightenment era european thought colonialism slavery thing emerge worldview actually make track call hostile categorization position mostly reason think complexity tends thing consistently upturn like categorization think liberation really lie acknowledge complexity human experience every point sort philosophical approach try make music come place authentic acknowledgement human complexity mainly one familiar definitely fed way collaborate people certain way way chosen disseminate music stuff also deep production deep production come place produce music develop methodology production really create sonic work immediately tick button oh yeah practice technical conceptual philosophy solo work collaboration people like delia gonzalez viva ruiz crystal ark time also member frankly one big band world put position member lcd soundsystem go stage every night play something people come expect sort sense familiarity want relationship song specific element curious hear generally like experience go work guy think casio drum machine track go take backing massive world tour huge festival stage impact solo creativity well take u experience sure little bit mind fuck complicate job mean kind dismissive way really thing like job much complicate job job work james building super casio modify synth still job less go stage perform synthesizer part lcd soundsystem song night night world tour less fluid thing grown even begin james would say oh really want play beat connection live crazy synth part begin know perfect person could work mostly financial limitation band meant possible hire go break bank certain amount gear certain amount logistics never work james get ready make happen think enough support behind felt like could thing think something always want hire actually play band also songwriting credit happen right totally weird way songwriting credit drunk girl song record think anybody would like songwriting credit drunk girl one touch one touch vocal backing vocal drunk girl song really different think almost lcd soundsystem song come musician actually jamming room lcd james create song back like make think drunk girl song know played drum live maybe still already record definitely tyler pope bassist al doyle guitarist studio room play like move back berlin like first thing maybe ever lcd context band kind like ok let something interest play kind time synth thing get edit somehow james take cut songwriting credit new record well always interest way studio work much mostly get call james like hey want come little synth thing tour like probably tour year year since one tour lcd year half long another tour american dream start january end june two half year road really unusual especially nowadays think much excitement band gotten back together tour one whole year record record come tour year half wild pretty consume pretty fast move think lcd song become something different become live song lcd record mostly think outcome james work studio craft thing layer layer play live become something really different like say even begin sort part brought thing studio totally nut thing plug one synth another know recreate live could every night lot work design end figure design synthesis system lcd take road measure degree timbral complexity james get studio brief comprise well think main thing happen kind one first thing james use em synthi studio time like constantly constantly super unstable even back one first job get hire like stabilize thing place rebuilt power supply stuff like go road like well go song center around one synth take road unpredictable lot research source kind begin eurorack stuff found analogue system think many different synthesizer company analogue something think analogue system analogue solution one think analogue system british company eurorack em synthi module kind begin oh ok would like oh one thing make let find another company eurorack kind grow become big thing go challenge seek one weird person make module wad massive field synthesizer module thing james really interested find ok thing people create able reproduce thing like intellijel envelope whatever envelope generator like close arp one us slider three speed setting get ultra fast arp envelope thing source ok different envelope generator one go sound like arp two thing lot kind interest design thing scratch essentially curating world building system really deep relationship play every night sort built whole thing understand system work several year lcd could hire tech help also technical information head time tech thing performance thing patch synth break song play another part song really interest weird headspace closest thing waitress constantly move manage different thing find like oh tiny space one song play microkorg break one song part go patch module next song come thing set sustain kind constant attention oh every night much write lcd soundsystem sort band creative unit thing feel see inside experienced part creative unit maybe gotten attention might think deserve think really compelling aspect community people overlook one reason another well think one thing think genuinely people say lcd great live band think much press attention gear way go beneath surface example say tour mostly big club show small arena show lot festival look lineup festival look go play club next day look bandwidth lcd successful band every single one band would run live show laptop record backing track live show essentially band operating level would mostly cd turn really loud maybe live guitar live vocal also vocal record people thing lcd zero zero zero zero track track laptop closest get mpc couple drum beat possible carry different vintage drum machine use studio pretty remarkable thing zero track nine people band tour well stage always six two swing ok obviously huge tech crew sometimes deep tour three bus three truck huge production think also james band credit feel like whenever tell people surprised like kind still think six u van pull synth huge production like work management production designer go work beyoncé gaga whatever people work high level music industry still feel like people play song really loud thing piano stage cp real piano five different analog synths play almost everybody else multiple analog synths two modular system craft really deep level get go lcd soundsystem show really genuinely something unique night even though come place work never play song way twice play song go part word part really different every night alive disparage people different way sort standard practice band operate certain level tour success run ableton behind scene really special thing see many people talk whether lcd soundsystem crystal ark work delia gonzalez peter gordon collaboration do year get space feel like sort dissolve bias favor group well interest happy see way say specific think collaboration general people come different goal preconceive notion curious navigate work musician last year make lot solo work also do lot collaboration yeah mean interest review question sent think one collaboration list many average person would list like wow lot people also collaborate people really different way know know interest thing art ego interpersonal relation funny talk big part musical development graduate art high school move back providence experience start kind improvisational psychedelic noise band cousin people punk band many year earlier first experience improvise really first experience step outside preconceive idea music instead like want make acid house like happens hold bass guitar front amp really really fertile time explore sound group set really amaze really amaze thing sort get together really know drum bass guitar like m keyboard time weird knock way box turn classic band situation go studio sat mixed record drummer like drum loud enough guitar player like hear part turn know see lot rock documentary stuff mean also well particular flavor like want experimental become push pull ego make big impression really painful experience thing go really magical thing felt like could fluidly operate within group maintain identity also feel kind negotiate exchange seem like powerful energetic thing move well like part think intense experience first really drove make solo work long time also meant tend engage collaboration really thoughtful way try find different way interpersonal experience music like say thing super different like mention collaboration traxx mean do different stuff traxx psych stuff come studio like idea want make two cover psych track take figure talk finally get like ok go want recreate sound psych record go play together go recreate track cool get totally peter gordon like would like come play arthur russell piece never perform live except three timesjames say want crystal ark case say artist met viva ruiz like hey make music want somebody vocal want vocal spanish want write something meaningful mean also clear idea nature collaboration mean collaboration delia think opposite total meld mush thing interest actually much common come together thing create really interest thing think know definitely complex thing collaboration really complex think like thing helpful take thing grant like oh yeah yeah yeah everybody know collaborate really think take apart bit like ok well collaborate really mean nature collaboration bring bring go happen go spend time make music together go send track something send back think becomes thing try pull away layer assumption go get little bit active ok something together like relationship somebody real rule rule come yes go like know mean mean relationship assumption whereas actually conversation pull layer apart little bit particular quote release xecond xoming black meteoric star think time come also long time finish come xecond xoming second come spell two x instead c quote previously described territory self discovery accompany make xecond xoming really resonant quote time come felt like become even resonant point decide publicly identify trans woman first time spoken lot history electronic music connection identity hop could speak little bit resonates journey musician context yeah well really cool appreciate bring quote interest interest parallel first black meteoric star sort suite come dfa finish think three year earlier four do one do sort marked end period time collaborate delia work synthesizer music sort marked personal emergence collaborative time xecond xoming sort similar thing crystal ark also like emerge time invest collaboration kind foist deeper personal vision kind push definitely big part experience work xecond xoming stuff yeah mean black meteoric star really transition lab know gender black meteoric star explore significant musically significant night club experience start build black meteoric star character character would dress blurring gender boundary one significant thing black meteoric star character always long wig get wear wig common experience among trans folk lot trans folk really love halloween get blur boundary could put headscarf head like get person actually world minute black meteoric star definitely like one many thing happen like get put wig world room full people club usually wear lipstick especially early day black meteoric star really work feminine mode performance dress mean lot performative thing one significant são paulo one important figure afro brazilian religion pomba gira know stuff complex something study really really really deep level significant part work research thing like research along multiple line eurocentric mode research anyway whole thing write special black meteoric star track call pomba gira change outfit dress pomba gira outfit always sort lab experiment thing nightlife significant also know thing type excavation creative level like ok really go inextricably connect personal authenticity work try push creative work towards think want go inevitably confront thing way authentically person create work mean go back composition professor would always say creative process one weed bullshit soul really whether say adopt philosophy definitely big part experience want continue evolve creatively grow work towards whatever deep aspect concern inevitably confront thing problematic difficult stand way actually person sort born destine trans experience broad differentiate trans feminine person aware long remember grow neighborhood lot people street talk remember really vividly walk street two woman sit porch like oh god look throw hip like grown realize assign male birth like oh god little boy love like six year old like oh god kind throw hip experience stuck always way well two thing way able relax truth also thing understand strange know degree public figure especially work lcd soundsystem way culture work actually become real state publicly whatever reason despite fact knew bumped bar would told girl think simultaneous inner inability deny truth couple outer necessity share truth weird kind go lot thing believe like person society need share everything opacity person publicly person privately depth know necessary time tour band popular play saturday night live start really get go happen transition like month play saturday night live talk head fuck amaze blessing somebody life work field pr kind pull aside like control story somebody else public eye moment reason necessity say go need tell story publicly otherwise somebody else go tell person whose story told incorrectly many time major moment able say actually idea powerful inner corollary experience go tour another month every single night front bunch people like go work go wear even though time seem like hard slept lot played show slept basically retrospect way almost kind make easy like let fear control job turn job guess could like sorry guy go begin like maybe put transition do tour remember therapy like year probably therapist like think option like yeah true option really happen way happen definitely kind complex interplay public private continue something worth unpack think also change way think lot thing mean visibility obviously complex issue trans folk traditionally think either invisible hyper visible ability people world think experience folk marginalize experience well something feel interest negotiate feel like whole bunch thing talk today whole complex different experience different influence around different people hearing different thing well many thing give different tool initially creativity tool kid grabbed onto creativity dear life thing make sense certain point found really find tool creativity amaze capable everything demand still incredibly important part process ability illuminate thing tend remain hidden keep make stuff mean know talk super long time last thing say big part experience body experience world intellectually actually inside body ultimately body telegraph truth gender thing beyond gender stuff much experience body happen dancefloors movement music whether like tour dancer black leotard front go berghain know like whatever across board one baseline critical experience experience like experience music physically move feel like authentic experience music look feel like think something different experience somebody occupies socially construct identity five day week like cut loose weekend sound judgmental critical think want make distinction something think significant potential dance music club culture entire kind social hold form part commodification term way sort sell dream contemporary culture stuff become like hyper commoditized like festival stuff pay bunch money come place get free place talk something different know similar similar thing talk try find term describe alternative culture within consciousness term co opt think bpm kick know strange synthesizer sound compelling vocal sample like thing time driven point deep embody self awareness like actually really point point something else construct much complex deep way connects like say traxx connects lineage connects ancestry connects thing come art object like remove social whole make product go consume little go back experience genuinely transformative like flavor get like transform shirt genuinely transform hopefully continue think really beautiful point end thank much applause thank
