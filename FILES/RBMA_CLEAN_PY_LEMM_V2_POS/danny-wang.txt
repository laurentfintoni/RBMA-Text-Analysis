thing possible likeever since time chet baker people say chet baker ella fitzgerald even possible without microphone people sing actually kind come back diva people whisper microphone sometimes without microphone possible mean opera kind sing th century big loud operatic aaah way amplify sound big concert hall technology good thing technology many time wonderful thing also want say thing repetitive always conflict want create tension build way bach debussy classical people write orchestra thing get trance mathematics professor guy talk yesterday think talk richard richard participant ok sorry care oh anyone know richard caretaker richard tall guy actually study mathematics show incredible graph yesterday certain chaos pattern know chaos pattern goofy thing get shake hand around look keep change different kind mathematical formula describe behavior population behavior human being like smoking tobacco interest start point graph show look like hey paper writes paperboard graph fascinate look like start simple mathematical formula pen oh ok random mathematical formula x x negative one third x plus x square equal negative four something really simple start dot simple ok graph look like bend bend bend bend exactly look strangely matter number put graph freeze stay right move describes behavior pattern obviously happens human society brain seem prove thing lock groove get trance get feel really good go argue know feel good deny thing certain point also thing call boredom mean like much know like emperor nightingale need say anymore picture say thousand word time get wonderful lesson african music fall trance repetition sings rhythm time u grab classical progression thing really make music beautiful think possible thing lot lesson na√Øve way people put together disco musicprobably closest thing ever get look everything abba basic like van mccoy hustle go play minute structure similar people like bach already bach create equal temperament keyboard play major scale keyboard pretty sound let change sound bit fiddle keyboard buzzy bach start play equal temperament keyboard around think really laid rule would use next year really discover rhythm yet way african america show u th century actually say africa america brazil obviously something parallel happen mixture european african culture incredible thing happen talk mathematics mathematics oh lock groove right get think maybe go move bach guess personal mission find become possible go get technical stuff question question far sorry please yes say back found list go get record list correct want listen find good want know mean like somebody say let find example like baskin robbins flavor life vanilla suddenly someone say shop get strawberry kiwi fudge vanilla everything go shop list make standard would deem good bad music necessarily say would get list sometimes bought record like play horrible sound like crap way like record way fast bpm know played drum machine think house music suppose bpm tony humphries dj make bmp possibly play go listen know bunch gay men tambourine stuff surprised lot record still realize maybe something learn record maybe good someone else thought hope answer yeah sure feel like quixote sometimes fight windmill yeah little bit wonder believe actually believe human being world dj really believe sound really corny really believe music universal thing closest thing love truth ever find believe music furthermore thing built brain would like prove discus seriously minute reach close enough touch everyone case massive commercialization mtv medium bullshit somehow accepted separate category tribe especially mtv white people black people suburban people urban people really function back human brain less especially come musicseem show u moment maybejazz bossa nova everybody get great bossa nova song like one note samba girl ipanema girl ipanema somebody sing sings sing happy birthday merry christmas sing solution problem solution red bull laugh hope say right hope go home take today good musician really play keyboard guitar properly get accumulate great knowledge thing everyone go home today longer content make make mostly guess structurally relatively simple repetitive thing base around loop content far maybe need time life take long time maybe year life discover go home conviction really matter repetition enough make simple hit enough make good music something hate say god mean god religious really religious islamic christian little bit buddhist maybe god rule physic mathematics universe even bach discover stuff calculate scale mi fa la ti universe anyway look around really sound like religious nut know look way plant grow fibonacci sequence around fact go get plant react grow music go universal stuff really quickly one minute rethink music dance music get played one example name hundred thousand actually go play probably know go number one first get sound get later george benson give night anybody know sings change change middle michael jackson wall sings know stuff start think record sort put category mind rethink music first page level zero invent always say danny run head right say big zero zero zero zero mean groove change thing dah dah dah dah dah go minute level one seem like record seem add sonic complexity example let make example record great groove absolutely nothing wrong oh great one great example chic want love one best disco group time well hundred although really fair say total disco groove actually subtle thing bass line already basically go back forth two key music chic want love chic sophisticated thought ok might say know danny know moodymann kick feel hit sample sample right well think talk level zero sorry level zero steal groove past loop repeat never change never varies never get key change never get anything never even get second lyric play believe hype care moodymann go hear go beat think moodymann care either right well know mean thing conviction people clearly know dance music know good chic try make something like instead steal people mean becomes moral ethical question musical question play devil advocate many people actually involve record like chic want love one guy maybe eight people well also thanks computer would say first one computer program stuff eight track make music either glad technology understand principle one person say go sound exactly like least give try get two three musician studio good violin player good horn player may come pretty close actually want talk minute also eight track could record many track beatles usefour track carpenter anyone know carpenter oh mathematics professor see richard audience happy point draw board show last time honky tonk lock groove pure pleasure carpentersused eight twelve track actually think much good music come carpenter little training little ingenuity good voice realize stuff protools like track really need really need track like drum bass really think another career sound really sarcastic okay level two move onto basic r b blue pop composition notice something like record like break like played might good example change complex start think actually minor like bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum change high high tension back original basic composition course also extend cyclical modular composition mean really modulate lot different key come back key go complex change let example think even play next balihu record found obscure classical record east european symphony orchestra do version debussy clair de lune composition think do disco version number okay number eight right might take minute two notice start simple tonal center go modulate lot different key lot color major minor wonderful nine thing violin triplet go dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah four beat okay one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay muisc oto gelb clair de lune hope pedagogic pedantic hear entire cycle modulation go know many bar thirty two bar something sound like something saturday night fever soundtrack yeah beethoven saturday night fever soundtrack debussy go say big classical fan example load classical know classical know lot people know perfectly train classical necessarily understand principle beautiful especially people force play classical violin piano early age think lot necessarily happy people like u deeply music especially want beat everything think great position appreciate kind stuff show u possibility actually want music furthermore something like triplet make perfect sense anybody play conga play latin percussion people come really really right get conga get boom chak boom chak often feel like back ga ga ga ga ga ga right triplet go exact thing violin get computer keyboard exactly thing keyboard conflict actually able put thing together would recommend year old kid day feel urge music oh yeah think people maybe play instrument computer yeah think would help think way use computer learn actually use computer feel end learn stuff help say like grow lot music come come computer whole scene people could afford computer guess lot u music yeah know hear say think right obviously technology way even piano get really move topic want keep day okay hope substance keep u interested even piano consider technology reject scale basically reject actually pure tonality go get right look another question another question torsten question torsten question lie couch political ramification obviously talk chic lush string arrangement lovely string especiallymany string player orchestra player played severe condition properly exploit nobody would want reduplicate kind thing yes okay think separate two issue first quality music make want say nothing every musician paid properly every artist general time illusion say something like actually nike fan beauty ugliness nike sneaker design way nothing fact whether child laborer china make social whatever realm realm pure aesthetic beautiful line shoe line nothing make line manufacture factory right get issue like thing absolute beauty music say go move scientific real reason describe beauty phenomenon music harmony tonality social condition right first sure musician really exploitedthink lot session player lot fact happy work large number east european classical playersnew york like look come studio play dollar afternoon come play piano mean play violin easy look play legatos play style mimic violin player da da da da da do okay bye get fifty dollar exploitation know write song producer serve role small cog machine accepted willingly think exploitation know think kind thing hire couple east european session player right plenty personally little fair hire session player pay quite bit actually friend especially say okay five people everybody get know day forty people furthermore social context consider normal might surprised people really play music think think much right think people music nowadays especially hip hop like yo make beat money wrong like anybody fuck sorry really play do somebody pay dollar fine really good musician know something else skill knowledge make exaggerated movement keyboard hold hand money think exploitation know people willingly nobody force way know ask serious question want like demonize like tambourine player know like funky town friend ashley told knew guy tambourine funky town da da da take funky town go street ask guy gay club tambourine bag come go give drug know go give cocaine come studio ok play tambourine track next three hour sure problem dum da da dum da da dum oh god sorry really make noise record make energy capture people exploit willingly probably die cause later know think certain extent person really make record producer possibly person play keyboard especially someone like quincy jones look george benson stuff central direct intelligence project ok go quick experiment actually anybody really know role orchestra conductor orchestra like guy stand baton anybody ever thought right quick experiment saw japanese tv really work amaze ok producer guy instrument vibraphone player halve room two section way way ok guy give note sing play c note keyboard yes go sing sing ah ok guy sing play another note ah nice harmony ah ah ok guy baton want ah ah ok right without central intelligence direct thing nothing happens everybody else right thanks want ever since saw japanese tv last year work program schoolchildren like sorry chairman mao question yeah curious know music james brown lateearlyfit ok firstly honest james brown know political element definitely totally important say important say loud black proud stuff one thing get back lock groove nothing wrong great rhythm beat harmonically think like stiff classical musician nothing happen harmonically james brown play beat bass line make funky boom boom chick right whole thing think talk social political dimension thing deny totally important musically much happen totally true like engineer producer know beat simple anybody could play boom chang boom boom chang drum machine james brown case bernard purdie fabulous drummer look record probably great engineer studio dynamic thing boom chang boom swing high hat fif fif fif fif fif fif right power life black music deny thing obviously come together like jungle fever track classic dun dun dun dun classic thing come together get huh sorry ok get think clavinet riff something come together beat worldwide disco hit thing come play answer question kind ok somebody say ok let go let one know see complex modulation let really hit dirt get back basic music theory talk inspires inspire everyone basic beauty music whole musical tone scale thing come know circle fifth circle fifth answer circle fifth key right ok get note go around around lot people know modest hold hand know ok important concept ok get tone scale first place let look quickly inaudible book hope something take home page three building scale alright book recommend anybody especially english native language comprehensive book topic give lot faith actually still keep stuff much page octave equivalence make harmonic music possible somehow thing play octave play music keyboard culture across world human being agree note sometimes even tell apart play play two f note play low f high f example mix together right high f mean two note across octave sing sound exactly alike ok let move page three xeroxed copy music brain ecstasy robert jourdain australia come interest octave equivalence truly universal harmonic phenomenon ethnomusicologist ever found culture human being agree mean u octave similar discrepancy certain australian aboriginal group never sing octave seldom range outside single octave want say primitive modern whatever amount interest actually greece become scale western europe china actually time stuff discover constantly refine way two totally independent culture contact figure go get chinese bell minute one interval go building scale right one interval appear universal crucial make scale thus make melody work frequency exactly midway octave concert hz go octave happens take guitar string cut half go one octave right hz one octave hz halfway point right knew knew actually really basic anyone really go put formal term see relates sound pedantic embarrass ethnocologists believe middle note found music culture suggest brain may inclined categorize course reason harmonic vibration controversy pre technological culture make tone sound even west longer consider moment call fifth play keyboard basically look go build scale play music people singer sing fourth know la marseillaise french national anthem sing first phrase wait someone french fran√ßais come serious somebody play music fourth play keyboard right fifth play keyboard know theme star war seriously standard thing star war somebody sing star war th yeah go sings star war theme fifth closest thing get nature absolute pure harmony except octave play keyboard octave th play keyboard right also give slightly chinese sound sort like thing know funny little try think funny little game stick remember name keep add stick right know go know go turn around let show ok get play keyboard find midway point note exist get scale say sings mi fa la ti mi fa la ti mi fa la ti sung differently mi fa accept correct way play note sound nice almost right especially tune thank nothing two note year bc find next note scale play keyboard know sound good star war another five thousand year come around inaudible comment exactly thank glad someone say get another note know sure note harmonic right note harmonic harmonic right get g let go octave play octave right get two note octave two note someone else answer go two note keep go right circle fifth mid point g g get three note scale fifth play right play star war theme let move bit th e thank someone know stuff wait someone classical opera blah blah blah thing right anyway know ok e play right e right let way prove actually work play right octave b b whats midpoint b fifth b one two three four five do white key move black key midpoint g flat ok move octave keep play upwards midpoint play midpoint right midpoint move play midpoint go right hold play midpoint talk b flat b flat think skip something play right b flat move f th note still correct f f midpoint c back right theory circle th perfect right make whole circle every note harmonizes actually totally wrong nature weird discrepancy keyboard may sound right let look mathematically really afraid would never get heavy know bullshitting ok move onto let see scale quick point say recognize first note even first place second equal temperament scale exactly whatever computer program reason blah blah blah say propellerhead company behind reason actually want work software laugh get equal temperament anything go get never go get fine color like somebody ask painting red blue yellow green purple green pink finer shade let take look tune anybody seriously electronic music recommend hold book tune scott wilkinson bible book although page inside show different possibility hundred different way play keyboard could split besides equal note color every shade purple pink brown gold every color could possibly imagine use get suck midi especially big auto tuner know christina aguilera aah know everything perfectly tune everything perfectly pitch beyonc√© whatever sound like shit reason let take look tune sense perfect equal temperament keyboard interval zero right side pure incent purer mean pure ratio middle half right might say multiply three let hz equal hz next octave hz get multiply three time two hz go octave take half equal ok let look mathematically derive modern day scale actually discrepancy show u keyboard quite right go next page page famous pythagorean comma pythagoras also man invent pythagorean theory anyone remember geometry school whatever ok do time go come back zero take basically go one time three half math multiply three get right time right ok three half th power right three half three half three half three half three half bring go half octave every time go reset original take faith draw keyboard would long ok seventh come back zero actually make zero equal exactly number look strange divide anyone calculator find one somebody computer somebody computer richard head maybe mathematics professor serious would like look number actually look far somebody right please ok let multiply number ratio ok multiply result concert ah perfect pitch multiply huh right happen thought play perfect harmony everything go end exactly back c actually still honestly answer would genius one mystery nature actually never solve one think strange mystical beautiful thing music mathematics irrational number know fifth perfectly harmonious one keep go fifth come closer closer harmonize original one never actually make spiral look read paragraph danny yeah emotion equation emotion equation yeah believe difficult accept faith harmonious music play moody keyboard chord feel little well play dissonant keyboard chord well necessarily let say play moody keyboard chord accept faith sound prettier play dissonant chord well dramatic really fair right step faith proceed say beautiful accept vibration work harmony beautiful oh rather draw board circle fifth actually look like might say like hz everybody see ok right circle fifth ideally equal might say equal temperament ideal actually reality divide two something reconcile well gotten little extra thing right little part call way name thank god actually work do whole life audience pythagorean comma point chart mean anomaly something explain extra little like human born tail get cut well know get use somehow take little pythagorean comma little six hz spread evenly note right get note sorry count right take little red part pythagorean comma go get little bit get th get th get th get th spread way knock thing create circle perfect circle equal temperament scale problem wonder mean tone work mean tone say like mean tone exactly go get actually actually right knock equal temperament bach say create equal temperament actually scale pure look uneven thing good go get minute look number equal temperament want modulate key key want go play chord keyboard play high chord keyboard need distance otherwise move go get tune want come back original note played right one note samba one note samba lyric sings song translate say sing english lyric mean inaudible answer lovely rule soon follow note still note sings melody want note go alone yeah go lonely end forest people relationship want everybody still alone end think also come back one note know whatever play note know whole song actually like key corny found key hope take key home use right come back one note address man audience seem know please hello expert know translate right come back note right take faith

temper actually think tone scale still tone mi fa la ti pure pure wonderful another whole tone scale tone equal temperament scale scale might say ok pure tone pure minor scale one blanking remember mean tone another one know thing scale harmonize well note scale like play keyboard right th important make melody get equal evil ok evil pythagorean comma make impure harmony distribute thing little bit evenly instead make equal temperament count six dah dah cut unevenly maybe fifth maybe get little little bit evil pythagorean comma let say seventh note play keyboard like note use much less scale get little pythagorean comma still six hz stuff get rid something put different place scale get scale like mean tone exactly talk mean tone think actually different definition different way spread think talk pure minor scale take little bit three four note use get evil stuff good note stay good good note stay pure mean tone think distribute evenly one get proportionate much like first one get eighth next one get sixth next one get fourth establish go want take little breathing break realize get bit academic heavy much fun fun think second lecture afternoon suppose finish yeah lunch ok want keep everybody hold let see much go may much right well actually since get discovery scale oh yeah let move quickly move onto theremin thing might already almost do ok harmony talk whole tone scale divide scale instead note seem human ear closely distinguish different number let say make scale note hum scale one would one would give u closest pure harmony music graph book actually calculate anyone know wendy carlos wendy carlos ok anyone explain famous record please switch bach switch bach right played one note time synthesizer course also invention moog synthesizer go get also become composer clockwork orange shin tron lot work also male female transsexual way discover point want woman oh record forget actually calculate various scale go long way explain simply throw computer try play human music possible think interest way probably rest life several record involve micro tonal tuning see graph experiment thing balinesean balinese yeah slendro scale pelog scale also pure mean
