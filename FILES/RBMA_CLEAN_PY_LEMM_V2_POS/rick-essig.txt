warm welcome mr rick essig new york lady gentleman thank still like spin vinyl good like see good last person screw record true actually music maybe end record deal maybe actually could man charge music sound good record stuff radiohead justin timberlake britney spear everything girl man know get stuff radio everywhere sound good maybe tell u little bit job people come people general close year enjoy cut vinyl get people start say death vinyl come cut vinyl every year big lie people love vinyl love cut vinyl great format really get cool sound vinyl really come across well digital point yet still kind one voodoo craft thing lot people really mainly machinery involve big frickin lathe get cut thing material specialized type paint like car paint piece metal basically lacquer master cool gig dance music guy dj mean great main source business work nice nice follow dj underground subtype label really vinyl nice would say actually dance music especially techno earlytook independent label would say save vinyl extend major production come vinyl anymore beginningpeople switch cd independent small label would still vinyl want hand dj oh yeah lot house underground stuff definitely think independent label kept alive much longer yeah although major label always always do kind funny lot promos amaze lot single release like jewel single longer frickin album get many goddamn mix double vinyl minute remixes one track put stuff general public see regardless kind stuff bring like might cd say cassette also master cassette vinyl would people bring start equipment would look format people would bring like finish music make go pain enjoyment usually like start project get crazy many different format people bring mp bring wavs bring split stereo file interweave stereo file mono file sd sd kind insane always try help people bring whatever master closest finish mix keep bounce around convert change thing generation loss generation loss say get digitally go get loss thing happen gotten file suppose stereo file one like slightly phase maybe two frame offset guy know happen go fix would usually hear listen would hear would worry yeah call guy tell people little bit perfect preparation job would prepare master say like cut tape yeah mean analog tape ideally go sound good certain aspect understand possible number one cost effective number two deal digitally sample stuff necessarily mean great record great record actually sound like great record bit sample little bad sound put together correctly still good record sample k master high re really high re high re copy low re record simplest thing could come do mix whether cd master dat want keep close do give know format take say like year obviously start bedroom production era everybody able sequencer plug everything set would see increase quality material sent stuff around could get compression plug thing like well still analog record stuff yeah mean quality wise yeah definitely early day dedicate engineer make mix project generally well sound quality bedroom production general suck think people get set necessarily familiar enough tool use maybe use optimally use many presets really dig around program really see type thing whole step miss day guy start mix engineer watch old guy year tell u little bit come engineer kind thing master thing important step mostly even know anymore miss step day lucky enough get door good studio usually start slop toilet take trash get coffee whatever could cleaning session wind cord low low bullshit really get first find serious hour week basically live also get see guy stuff also get see signal path work signal path actually happen sound either guitar vocal way final tape lot stuff go big juggling act get good sound tape mean process learn buy kind stuff really set mix program way really get something do may great record may sound close good could sound really familiar stuff use line mean easy really pretty digital mix tool guy put steinberg stuff actually look like piece analog gear really let say production home way know fight way plug in maybe gear get sly important compare stuff want sound alike important actually listen stuff speaker home important lot time new client especially say record dr dre record make record sound like record well sure go happen dre people around know put record together record sound like really goal system house put dre record dre record sound system try make mix sound close possible may crappy system home whole comparative thing really get ear tune specific sound mind want get may sub know subsonic level crank low end tell little baby flump around like look like enough low end actually get record like ohhhh whooowow way much really familiarize heard bad record world come hit factory book day horrify heard great record come people basement individual gear go buy gear experience know waste money people anyway home fiddle around compression plug in de essing l ultramaximizer ultra maximize stuff evil evil tool make harder actually master guy people take much life stuff would suggest never put two track compression mix make sound good let guy way really problem need fix mix need something brought brought headroom much easy sound much well almost like people like ey finally get square wave rooooocks farthest truth whenever ask say put anything end worry loud last thing worry loudness lot people important record might sound good put cd sound good bring three four notch would sound mariah carey record whatever process track job make loud would go dream thing would go limitation format yeah mean ultimate deliver bit khz cd master unless go sacd superaudiocd even get bit thing convert format actually worry loudness afterwards know process track eq compress whatever get right dump workstation edit put need put punch volume peak stand compression make sure nice flat kind like basically like vu meter know lot people use thing day far vu reading peak modulation record would zero vu plus minus whatever level put record record let say plus five peak record would transfer cd thing say basically limit would would add eight db gain get plus eight zero cd basically far push competitive line people go mean horrify listen software software would keep like red line know yeah thing tool specifically design mean many record cannot sit whole thing something annoy sit minute music like grind teeth let say afford give stuff someone like pay matter disrespect would interest use l ultramaximizer sure get get go deliver record plant make stuff yeah know get use somebody suggestion people proceed maybe crack wave plug in see tough work entire analog console drop input level certain device overload thing along way like little bit little bit little bit final thing may luxury pump chain mean go along eq drop certain frequency increase one first input level console get mix someone already scream hot drop input level console db start rebuild try fix whatever problem go end unfortunately add gain master would send terribly loud embarrass send quiet master take anyway yeah go track would subtract let stand within want would add depends thing want cut thing might want add one engineer always add sometimes take away well deal lot time people way much scream like khz roll right bat go bring bass try fight whole check balance thing many year build kind card file thing sound good reference reference head work go like ok type music think seem need say bass mean talk lot studio compression stuff like obviously hardest thing people get bass right like bass hardest frequency yeah either fight kick fight bottom end talk even use sub studio believe sub explain u well studio giant speaker adequate low end environment absolutely none mean get hear something think people tend fool sub set right really want get accurate really tune actually listen necessarily flat accurate hear everybody hears different lot people afraid record club actually sub stand might sound like scream mid range put enough sub master purpose would try create mix would work club well little kitchen radio see kind myth long do right sound good anywhere really say go radio mix radio guy beat crap record anyway pretty much dead hit airwave fit crap little bandwidth airwave plus want scream loud try mix hear super harsh people think well need make brighter get ta less low end radio maybe truefinished track home make good possible mackie mixer wherever always go listen different speaker car different size speaker well point relatively sound obviously go difference huge difference issue boomboxes boomy something mix make boombox boomy go weird question basically thing maybe ron murphy cut record right studio yeah lathe studio stuff analog well console use digital workstation well use basically tape machine edit purpose assemble master cd need lot time people deliver record either three different source sequence dump sequence cut participant best type format give would stereo file go use pro tool file yeah keep em link separate float around somewhere mean know may supposedly find guy charge buck per hour get cd do leave anything chance may end cd f real easy slip stereo file load st file directly onto sonic solution system interpret like sound designer basically stuck two single file left two right get align time wise get guy really hip right could problem interleave stereo file screw common let call mistake drawn people turn mix come big studio major production studio somebody home pin usual mistake people like mechanical force medium also people mix vocal guitar stuff like usual mistake people make put vocal high add many high know people like different thing client listen want would drive insane client client service guy guy want super stupid bright guy like lot low end like bright always personal taste obviously glare mistake say dude problem might able fix know people like vocal way hell basically work stereo file people would come eight file would like do make sure make cost prohibitive come often like compilation deee lite stuff dmitry brill member deee lite dmitry finish mix actually rent gear mix record master session place yeah stupid money mean like uff get guess add something spend much time fuck song work know let let move sit torture describe bit process master lot people really know difference engineering master first really hopefully somebody trust last set ear listen make objective change record close record tough really make informative decision may sound right kind like extra trust set ear say alright know could probably fix little bit little bit kind weird unless actually put vinyl super necessary step yet lot people think need obviously think help give like think need do really make thing shine last bit spit polish describe specifically like radiohead album bring process say lil kim record come jay z record three different remixers remix track three different guy three different place initially listen three say get certain amount continuity since guy talk probably go first step say alright need bring little bit closer together flow type thing one track may ultra maximize one may one may super stupid low end one may nothing get look kind reference head whatever listen sound best try adjust come reference point basically eq compressor basic stuff de essers use compressor overall track yeah good one though yeah basically chain would go couple eq actually compress eq afterwards tend get pump compress eqed signal think easy compress flat signal need deal number one may add much eq hearing miss track begin preference guy do maybe next year change know ever time let say hip hop artist artist bring music unmixed say like master could please share experience something brought life felt like oh unmixed something mean unmixed mean always go two track form yeah two track stereo mean oh yeah time lot client like alright get thing come suggestion yeah guy come session anymore mail deal master come studio really know even hearing know hearing room every day guy get use would rather show sit couch eight hour get pretty tire play sega golf game get old principle thing come basically mix place track exactly equipment maselec transfer console three piece unit one analog input input output converter analog gear go back input whatever source come whether tape whatever plug go console broken bunch different section input section insert section output section different filter width control neat little gizmo analog thing go maselec compressor sontec master eq another sontec split left right parametric eq go another de esser analog peak limiter pretty much use cut vinyl use cd though go back converter convert digital whatever nonsense get put make loud go ultramaximizer l everybody get l ok get something man p nice record right yes free master yes something lot mix end eq bring high little bit l l ultramaximizer right exactly since knew go give someone master demo crank system music unknown big problem goddamn multi disc player really fuck everybody could put five ten really start go oh get turn thing put one time already stereo system like saying turn anyways yup nobody want get couch music unknown kind boofy technical term boofy music continue yeah lot time subtract work lot well add cover stuff would piano like hertz range participant think piano little bit loud loud something low range key low mids thing need think tinkly know mean
