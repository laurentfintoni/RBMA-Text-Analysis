good spirit gentleman sit next actually help u try figure noise come know little bit noise stuff therefore would like ask join welcome mr dave smith applause thank early mr tomita ask whether ever met wendy walter carlos walter wendy carlos wonder actually remember album come switch bach snowflake dance switch bach yes one thing initially get interested electronic music synthesizer shape form interest hear something electronic sound lifelike way played sound like acoustic instrument know electronic life amaze hear way played record could actually hear radio get contact know bought album doubt played radio probably remember never know meanright best sell classical album time might still know record ever broken pretty amaze synthesizer beat big orchestra might bias might time year come lateremember probably still college even remember year come anybody know know probably still college college uc berkeley electrical engineering computer science play band side play guitar bass guitar berkeleyanything close imagine yeah somewhat regularly pretty crazy crazy form know tact squad come street tear gas whatever get silly time also pretty interest period live protester protester observer would watch get actively involve mean think talk music electronics time kind interest close actually overlap actual current affair like friend tom oberheim live building guy found watergate document example bizarre little overlap think like hey hollywood scriptwriter thought crazy time go recognize necessarily study electrical engineering computer science look like mean mildly different well yeah everybody probably tire hearing use like young computer huge write program punch card turn computer center wait hour get back see compile slow process one thing probably still write program compose music way could get print plotter draw five line draw circle put asterisk middle quarter note pretty rudimentary way back thing basic machine processing room size computer would control data one computer think long go remember dad computer book time little later actually photo someone extremely proud tic tac toe drawn onto screen like one day machine able play tic tac toe yeah remember senior year one professor predict one day power one computer would cost course everybody like way course thing fraction power iphone day still care magnitude law data storage processing power go actually well take advantage whatever technology available design new product usually think detail say need kind part kind memory basic back processor memory input output make computer course instrument least one many computer thing opinion much actually need know want use something like efficiently hopefully zero job right nothing computer make music way approach first start implement circuitry order generate music well yeah start make instrument use first product actually analog sequencer bought minimoog play around decide build thing go built decide try sell always user point view engineer point view much minimoog back money car time right yes pretty good car actually good car car laughter pretty good bad could buy new car amount get university time right yes work aerospace industry time nobody want hire engineer become silicon valley quite silicon valley yet early technical revolution suppose might say work lockheed stupid work place could get job friend told saw synthesizer thing music store say oh sound interest go look minimoog idea work look cool kind perfect combination music background technical background next day go lockheed credit union get loan go back bought applause yeah guess another thing might need thank military industrial complex indirectly mean machinery kind look similar would found actual lockheed product right maybe suppose get back basic make parallel bought minimoog probably similar experience mr tomita earlier described even deal modulars still little bit painful anyone every bought something era room anyone ever try something era room guess first moment kind similar everyone go like yeah actually make sound good master well trial error hop internet find something work play around doubt book think even manual come minimoog kind slowly figure work people never figure famous story heard way back english friend mine go pink floyd studio saw minimoog cover duct tape ask instrument cover tape apparently somebody would find sound like roadie come tape knob always sound early programmability guess would take live environment mean band decides play encore need roadie wheel next one doubt live yeah use minimoog live pretty much know unless use sound turn cutoff much saw machine actually relate stuff learn school know already waveform stuff virtually nothing take lot computer class take basic electronics class absolutely nothing learn oscillator filter forth deliberate decision start built first unit go sequencer mostly something want play read book even know found moog make big sequencer everybody know analog sequencer like assume row knob send control voltage synthesizer control pitch filter whatever probably first hurdle lose lot people control voltage well depends far back want go many synth expert ooh ok work many people kind know way around synth ok well well want get far mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo actually kind good good chance lot people sleep physic class one stage start figure like oh hang actually help could give u cliff note version think lot people might really helpful actually kind relevant like say basic subtract synthesis analog synthesizer pretty much pass test time around good year still use every day use analog form use digital form access virus nord stuff software synthesis implement subtract synthesis since revival analog lately real thing back basically start oscillator harmonically rich different shape different tone color pas filter everybody know filter take stuff pretty much basic concept start lot sound filter want use envelope basically control shape change sound whatever reason happen synthesis method really easy understand relate mean sure know happens turn cutoff knob filter sound everybody heard everybody relate synthesizer know knob go really kind classic sound think go around long time compare fm synthesis nobody figure program clue something subtract synthesis accessible something like perfect patch kind thing could probably nifty setup could use one machine get little bit probably demonstrate talk sure nice thing prophet simple every control front panel like instrument go different page many feature forth get could actually make whole front panel life let go real simple sound musical tone ok simple get single sawtooth musical tone yeah sorry saw something earlier camera impression signal bad musical tone want hold note hold note go cutoff musical tone everybody know sound like usually little bit resonance musical tone basic sound analog synth course could add second oscillator musical tone beef little mostly matter modulate thing change sound real time add lfo change lfo thing ok lfo thing really get basic class ok go learn year worth synthesis class five minute laughter main oscillator sawtooth listen audio frequency hear pitch really low frequency oscillator hear pitch might change twice second basic shape low frequency oscillator musical tone hear change frequency modulate pitch main oscillator hard without blackboard describe go otherwise use low frequency oscillator change frequency main audio oscillator try hand wave instead blackboard hand wave low frequency oscillator use usually use vibrato modulation wheel hooked way synths easy way get sort articulation sound control play live much first start think process follow people think oh know today go introduce waveform like certain set felt get oh machine need talk specifically design product little familiar minimoog look front panel prophet see lot similarity kind get start minimoog back minimoog arp odyssey two big instrument day since get minimoog look like minimoog whereas gotten arp odyssey maybe would look like arp odyssey basic always sawtooth wave always pulse wave often triangle wave always low pas filter thing given beyond lot thing different prophet first polyphonic synthesizer monophonic polyphonic thing buzz word funny thing minimoog first come since keyboard lot people would go first thing play chord one note would play go go broken concept thing people would see keyboard would piano organ could play chord argument like go say well get trumpet play one note wheel different control minimoog actually articulate much single note monophonic monophonic mean one note place one note time lot benefit original use minimoog usually play lead line solo bass line often lot people want able play one note time play bunch note call polyphonic voice multiple voice prophet actually first polyphonic programmable synthesizer come late dr bob moog record earlier sort role model least product say god would want u one voice would give u want hear one need form choir mean good business need sell synths way play chord yes might help polyphonic synth definitely everybody really always want even lot monophonic synths know lot fun play actual play polyphonic unit even though time lot people try push boundary say like well keyboard limit u actually create new instrument start think old term pretty close right well always argument fact look back synthesizer history original synthesizer actually invent two people time bob moog east coast buchla west coast actually berkeley main reason bob moog well know put keyboard synthesizer buchla different type controller reason want limit call black white everything play note note buchla also first invent sequencer invent lot thing synthesizer think bob moog even say may built modular synth people realize mean moog really marketable name well well flashy name minimoog come kind keyboard portable reasonable cost fairly available mean everywhere people think million minimoogs think like built world musical instrument huge number still lot moog modulars right definitely like buchla system yeah definitely get educate guess many unit sell idea mean definitely less four digit guess yeah would think actually hear people machine actual people behind building well would hear probably meet bob lateprobably little later met buchla alan pearlman another person found arp alan r pearlman name arp come guy run company course tom oberheim roger linn rest gang consider shape form competitor shape form laugh boxing bout filter well actually friend always get together trade show animosity place fun back course easy innovate none do every year would fun see people would come new everybody knew everybody get along trade show mildly different mean namm basement hotel right show prophet january namm show many namm show many people know namm show ok big trade show musical instrument world actually funny story first show basement disneyland hotel big january namm show back summer namm show chicago huge instrument market piano organ brass instrument band instrument company base midwest huge show kind start tiny shoot los angeles anaheim next year technology take become west coast industry january show get big big big eventually summer show go away disappear year recently brought back small show nashville summer guitar orient show make sense real interest see whole music industry kind move west technology take curious say earlier valley much silicon around profit way company cluster well sure yeah everything intel high tech company close definitely help go say ok really love machine want guess would obviously go internet go like oh want curtis chip want thing like actually go certainly get silicon mold etch two part lead development prophet one already background microprocessor knew work day job use microprocessor real obvious thing use microprocessor make programmable polyphonic synth thing knew people e mu system probably know across town heard involve develop new chip set oscillator integrate circuit filter circuit envelope vca say oh well obvious take part put together microprocessor build polyphonic programmable synth know two thing lead first even start design figure obvious idea moog arp would already wait month figure well maybe heard anything decide sort jump pretty crucial step guess kind go way people try decide whether want pursue career music start business like wow really put behind get take risk point mean start sequential circuit something night weekend regular day job work engineer wait point kind hit critical mass kind jumped quit job say go big company actually grow sequential circuit peak people maybe something like lot also lot administer yeah headache actually get people help side like someone else stuff little hard know kid kind work way thing get kind control great time time also difficult competition kept get ratchet every year fortunately couple year first come much competitionstarted get crowd get crowd look back guess kind new company would do differently age well circumstance different really kind unfair comparison company dave smith instrument completely different tiny company u think design tool much efficient much really one software guy one hardware guy three u pretty much design product faster quicker big company small marketing department sale department people tell u whatever want make u much efficient do way back obviously easily source let say motherboards etch customize chip kind stuff one main reason many people back built unit silicon valley real factory time around contract manufacturing though built across town instrument still built san francisco export advantage local production built china headache factory big difference speak factory market get crowd stage japan enter game well remember first visit remember first visit probably time mostly year back first visit year whatever reason sure big gap kind fun come back see change remember trip first one probably around maybe reason go visit japanese distributor learn company like roland already knew mean obviously everybody sell instrument go trade show meet people company already know go yamaha roland korg sell thingscompanies guess fundamentally different whereas look lineage yamaha come company compare roland example could explain little bit well yeah big difference yamaha year old company whatever everything built piano built motorcycle built sailboat bathroom kind stuff classic big company dx thought sell maybe sell never quite understood direction go want roland completely different roland found ikutaro kakehashi san engineer sharp guy first x amount year roland completely driven product driven company kind central person vision difference get huge company top big difference two company kind fascinate probably motivate well look lot history lot guy one company lifetime way read let say quincy jones biography go bankrupt like three time mean look maybe rather german way approach germany ever fail might well commit suicide do guy go oh ok let start another one glad german change name guess someone lineage mean kakehashi san different company beforehand well right well hammond japan ace tone know structure exact company guy kind good right yeah saw last week visit hamamatsu still trick hear yeah roland kind split start another company age know exact age get least would think bit entrepreneurial research spirit yes talk circuitry little bit everything actually met probably know get grammys together able come la ceremony get chance meet actually one reason come stop visit kind fun kind catch thing mean guy work together something also know midi eval earlylong story want hear guess folk settle nighttime story start guess happen prophet first musical instrument microprocessor soon company start make instrument microprocessor microprocessor instrument realize easy communicate digitally another instrument microprocessor accessory polyphonic sequencer remote keyboard number thing special interface developed purpose actually serial interface ten time faster midi roland something call dcb bus oberheim another bus yamaha everybody something different course product different company would connect u sort figure kind dumb industry go go someplace fix point industry still pretty small synthesizer decide get somewhat aggressive deliver paper aes convention new york october aes audio engineering society technical organization audio engineer present paper something call usi universal synthesizer interface basically kind call arm say need interface could actually fully define interface say start point something follow meeting january anaheim namm show invite anybody make keyboard kind come meeting think well attend thing say usi thing perfect want get involve become clear really quickly people people want high speed parallel bus people want wait see people invent syndrome idea want invent syndrome nih standard engineering term nih mean bad idea idea somebody else laughter invent forget little discourage meeting happen roland people approach next day say well u still want go booth met roland korg yamaha kawai willing get together something say ok let start work kind crazy like japanese company yeah interest time yeah basically start start work throughout remember meeting get close do towards end year might around october kakehashi come visit u sequential kind finalize thing go spec suggest change name instead usi universal musical instrument interface synthesizer make sense thought kind cool pronounce umii mean synthesizer connect sort thing thought little bit quite like idea meeting kind threw well musical instrument digital interface everybody go ok name come military come general midi much later nothing leave one leave one something lot people actually experience try use midi make one machine talk god forbid third one enter layman term way explain solve midi problem really quickly well depends basic idea midi basic interface simple plug play note work usually midi problem come try map controller synchronize clock sort thing usually something simple make sure setting right use right clock sort thing midi problem mean lot different thing different people general midi survive year version cheap implement fairly easy implement developer important fairly simple still cover people need people way people talk midi forth could significantly complicate use want everything would nice unnecessary people want actually fairly simple system use imagine would hard guess sort technique help determine actual problem lie find quicker standard procedure check thing standard thing talk b talk much keep hearing something without anything well basic anything audio make sure cable plug right place work audio much midi do everything set work oh plug big university get everything set work lack one midi cable plug one audio cable plug start point suppose make sure actually go instead way around mean talk forever mean still go forever even extremely accomplish remember situation mr linn mr oberheim two rather season producer stand around think tempest another module hour sound palm spring palm spring yeah take think best relief everyone room like ok guy figure time go chill laughter probably miss cable good chance yeah use midi number reason well actually intend first place laughter clock original spec picture computer control thing even though computer pretty basic back knew future yeah kind thing use big problem people always complain midi slow initially problem midi slow instrument slow u guilty put microprocessor instrument ask microprocessor way much stuff try keep cost use cheaper microprocessor back expensive microprocessor busy midi note come say well take long time actually play problem slow midi problem microprocessor quickly play note quickly enough nowadays speed issue almost always usb transmission speed problem one interest thing want look philosophically musical kind sense actually able disconnect various sound source actual play device guess open realm possibility intend degree remember one something call local control turn surface instrument work midi remember might first spec remember year ago man come laughter like yeah sometimes hard enough remember go last night yeah start think oh hang actually allows separate unit probably sell part rack mount version without keyboard cost stuff guess keyboard controller relatively complicate develop depend amount expression want give like pianist would extremely manifest hammer mechanic whatever want stuff like touch instead simple kind thing wonder start factor yeah far module versus keyboard think come later backpeople still like stack keyboard onstage even connect midi look good thought look good pile like remember think midi module sequential later everything pretty much still keyboard mechanic keyboard get complicate mechanically electrical part usually pretty simple like prophet velocity touch basic come ever since obviously everything start introduce product actually one instrument kind go way overboard prophet t actually wood key long sense velocity fly hammer hit key would actually hit hammer would move little optical sensor sense velocity actually polyphonic touch pretty rare note key kind take extreme people still like prophet t lot people still think best keyboard ever felt fact start sell synclavier want good keyboard thing could find would feel good enough put keyboard also pain as thing wood would take u six seven hour unit actually regulate keyboard almost like regulate piano keyboard plastic metal wood realize something like run actual company like siren go building like holy shit developed something actually take lot work actually facilitate never like find thing like part gig kind deal whatever come always predict everything favorite product era within house well prophet first one always like first child beyond like pick favorite child say best one best one musical instrument flavor like even prophet also prophet polyphonic synthesizer sound different people like sound prophet well people like sound prophet well thing guitar player pick whether want play strat le paul telecaster whichever one feel right go try make keyboard give kind connection musician personality character kind goal much actually talk musician figure want talk musician lot usually fact come product welcome feedback go ask feedback develop would distract year pretty good idea want new instrument mean come perfect one reason develop product fast ask feedback another thing see happen company see new product come tell design committee kind loses focus look like well somebody want idea push hard get somebody else want idea two idea really mix correctly design musical instrument think pretty clear focus tricky mean easy few people involve easy hold aim product obviously classically train musician jazz musician virtuoso tip like brian eno world probably much manual possible yeah people swear never read manual people say erase every preset first get instrument start scratch mean get little bit everything yeah actually good point anything mind say ok machine dubstep really good nobody go buy mean target instrument particular musical genre style build think go good instrument kind let market decide sometimes come something fashionable time five year later becomes fashionable ten year later year later never know come prophet v nobody want initially stop building year later everybody want still high demand know classic example come nobody want kind around go away course know people would kill get one fashionable time u building drum machine roger linn invent digital drum machine sample base everybody want sound real great sound roland product come everybody kind laugh say sound anything like thing would anybody want nobody bought somebody realize later oh wait get personality different kind music really well always know say fashionable turn quite lot product around day almost like season feel like approach like fashion designer way like oh need something ready year model actually really try make huge jump instrument look line synths see lot common thing use try innovate new thing one something nobody else want try get caught rut building thing kind silly try make fashion statement try make something think sound really good think people might like go decide enough knob box laugh hardest part design funny know people company lot young learn last couple year hardest thing teach leave perfect system come feature idea say answer always yes course great idea put product nobody figure nobody use see ad soft synths say take year learn everything product go would want spend year learn use product want use keep simple art decide feature keep powerful enough lot thing simple enough wrap head around quickly still monophonic one get three time number knob favorite one year later day lot thing kind limitation still try shoot knob per function interface feature knob switch grab dive menu menu dive nothing anybody want deal try make music stop software synthesizer whole thing kind seem silly heavily involve software synthesis long time probably people know pioneer status field enough obviously everyone always associate anything prophet related tell u little bit venture solely software base president company call seer system midkind go three step thing first built probably world first commercial software synthesizer contract intel whole lot second generation advanced pentium come computer get faster one actually pretty cool mostly general midi synth little bit extra bell whistle license creative lab sell million sound card computer get slightly faster developed something call reality first professional software synthesizer maybe pretty cool subtract synthesis fm sample physical model stuff one software package fairly interest back learn year sometimes bad early market late market manufacturer go first namm show reality people walk say get get software synthesizer oh play note say new product well software synthesizer software run computer mean concept completely foreign people take couple year think probably native instrument first come pro people finally start realize software synthesizer ever offer part game get nothing stephan schmitt admit kind get idea saw seer system happens lot think kind cosmic balance like look moog try look someone else like give take thing well call polymoog maybe would actually use name exactly knob minimoog maybe think difference building something versus copying ever consider legal action nah dislike deal legality get patent fact new company make pledge year ago start see far could get without use lawyer yet still use one far good united state america believe pretty impressive time though mean guy people place definitely youth side mean u like holy fuck like half year rent worth machine like thing know someone cd writer guess yeah mean lot really good thing software synths cheap free like say box really nice everything laptop sound good sound good sound good know reason use case epiphany one day realize reason never play reality product start ask well play always play instrument realize well type type type click click drag drag click clack play note click click drag look feel musical instrument seem wrong like say first person make software synthesizer first person stop make software synthesizer decide go back hardware see happen elsewhere see software company like arturia make analog synthesizer well make software synthesizer like tell u stuff sound like analog well sound like analog need build one guess also make lot sense pure capitalist reason mean physical box still sell like say hardware ultimate dongle laughter say play player really glad get picture actually congratulation dave smith archive slideshow video screen must like sunnyvale first office probably four meter four meter love moog poster background like fan rock band something wall right let quickly switch look early prophet day probably slightly big factory think probably know two three thousand square foot little later last year current line go buy please drum machine lot people ask update come firmware include man leave year think another one come probably within month still involve write actual code stuff like product one guy work new product something work always right secret anything want tell sorry good look gentleman good picture bob moog kakehashi tom oberheim namm show la happen la stay la go tell u actually interest guy rene italy every year would come namm would something call pasta rene would go somebody house maybe u dinner put together make food sit eat drink one party know roger linn would usually sometimes artist would show kind informal thing let guess played guitar musical instrument get do namm anybody well one guy namm first hour ear start bleed leave namm even last thing want hear music cure temporarily unfortunately favorite bob moog story like tell people half bottle tequila know favorite story know something kind relate ask minimoog sound good go know funny designer instrument say well need oscillator need filter kind put part together never really know package go sound completely do mean idea hope go sound good always last magic part put whole thing together always explain sound good hard guitar string sound good interest way look design musical instrument far design go people like roger kakehashi san mainly come rhythmical instrument come sound timbre kind fabric find result different way engineering machine well funny couple thing first first product sequencer synthesizer actually start rhythmical instrument roger linn actually guitar player kind built drum machine story unreliable drummer idea confuse people start actually record thing record camelinndrum base kind take surprise think people would actually use way take mechanical sound make music intend purpose still love say rap hip hop giant quotation mark around word laugh yeah think father hip hop mpcs kind hilarious know roger wow lot people actually kind cool picture take stanford university might best single photo lot cool people start left john chowning basically invent fm synthesis stanford university could call father dx forth yamaha buy house think probably take care pretty well stanford university certainly make lot money licensing technology even though ask john say yamaha hard work become instrument without hard work kind come idea modest ever ask whether chance make easy take three people program dx right well kind loop yamaha instrument designer like mention earlier yamaha idea go take right combination lot cheaper instrument velocity new voice big analog instrument still six eight voice sound like fender rhodes people bought weigh whole lot less fender rhodes back people still take rhodes tour weigh couple hundred pound midi one earlier midi instrument lot lighter c yes lot like c also well see left roger linn right buchla next two tom oberheim old gentleman middle actually leon theremin next max matthew father computer music computer music bell labsgreat combination influential people world synthesis two think paul lasky composer david wessel earcam long time run symnet electronic music uc berkeley know good suit though yeah know everybody forget people also think tell middle school like write name picture five year remember oh wow picture three four day ago actually stop visit kakehashi first time get together since award last year fun visit afternoon call model first product ever maybe rhythmical instrument rhythmical instrument yeah kind work like imagine might look know sequencer work built figure people might want buy start company call sequential circuit think sell four laughter boom business think throw bridge oh care amaze could sell anything spec sheet model ok amaze first midi connection ever namm show look like jupiter actually play jupiter time couple roland people somebody wear cool satin sequential circuit jacket still lie around somewhere yes denise one home day actually go wear public xl well see something like everybody say oh get remake never know day might start take order still hold name right yes actually recently get back ever tempt sequential ii talk someday maybe something particular plan let take vote change name company dave smith instrument sequential circuit somebody say yeah yeah ok jacket yeah use yeah ok inaudible yeah could would like could anything want best part laughter yeah like know start side business like prime limited line exactly yeah prog rock typo like prophet lettering use something come year ago remember back something like anybody know letraset get sheet letter different font rub onto paper use thing like prophet even sequential circuit letraset font think get font inaudible could could around corner well yeah could sell apple well would work prophet roland jupiter prophet actually first midi instrument kind ship december month later roland jupiter come happen namm show show jupiter show prophet one point informal decide bring product booth kind make room stuck get midi cable connect actually work people ask well press big thing say well kind mean whole thing informal do midi usual way get standard make take year year year committee document da da da bypass basically throw fitting first connect two instrument pretty much virtually fanfare involve see fanfare moment oh yeah great origin midi eval early prophet ad sphinx come know brain guy really cool airbrush john maddis actually still around ran couple month ago san francisco know come idea probably say want legend time come find wood find wood guess lot still minimoog influence original minimoogs do wood first prophet make wood call koa stun beautiful wood limited supply stop use think make walnut maybe forget switch kind idea analog synthesizer organic wood kind warms back lot people hear doctor lawyer buying prophet living room furniture make great heater well yeah another early ad back day try explain people programmable synthesizer could fact could actually hit button completely change sound really get number different instrument one today wander street shibuya walk music store prophet cost cost new store dx basically market vintage digital gear huge market vintage analog ask year ago think people still use would laugh mean thought design something electronic would use long mean think nobody anything electronic two three year old might something toaster might little old basically old electronics keep old electronics run like non trivial thing whole concept electronic instrument old think strange pretty resourceful though mean sound good applause really pro wow cool one kind funny think mention earlier everybody else start make polyphonic programmable synths two three year decide kind hell build non programmable monophonic synth kind turn upside try make inexpensive could look funky weird plastic use probably try little hard make cheap sound way sound people like way sound another one completely accidental kind cool well take since expensive ton people bought know really big uk europe general cost make available people know lot cool music make example kind thing way early catch earlybasically programmable modular effect device anybody programmable effect idea could buy distortion unit mixer delay phase shifter whatever plug one rack become programmable could set different effect turn knob make sound press button remember setting whatever reason fairly expensive never really caught back thing catch stop move kept probably would successful get cheaper small oh well still smile bad monster prophet story first prophet actually two version could buy either prophet prophet exactly case difference prophet twice much electronics inside could play twice many voice turn reliable even less reliable would probably well way put get hot sell many discontinue always seem like come proper prophet built monstrosity two keyboard polyphonic sequencer fun box huge yeah good fun need rearrange living room yeah pretty much hire two strong guy carry prophet rack version guess rack version go couple year later first sampler difference sampler back way digital sample would actually play back analog filter really give different sound kind hate use usual word kind softens make rich whatever want say definitely use analog filter digital sample really affect sound original drum machine way linndrums drum track forth turn completely digital always slightly different sound button look oddly familiar yeah one also matrix program necessarily best interface kind problem thing happen dx get point many parameter control get really difficult come usable user interface certainly much challenge navigate mean modular version tenth knob yeah would fun one show actually quick main control hit want program oscillator hit oscillator switch display clear easy read fast even though technically menu system really hit one button hit another button turn knob everything quickly accessible display care sort way display year obviously really foresee mean know ok go standard issue even work use step simple set parameter whereas really need like fore plan design well thing like turn use thing like oled display eventually gradually get slightly dimmer well talk year old instrument suppose design last year probably replace year know around care somebody else deal
