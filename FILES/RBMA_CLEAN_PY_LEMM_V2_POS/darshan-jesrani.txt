common ground music interest similar term mood wise also old style electronic music revive old production sound technique metro area really start year met initially lot foundation building talk music record together name metro area couple track really go anywhere one track name phenom come compilation idea use metro area today already morgan come name metro area morgan come name originally want start house music label call metro area eventually become name project metro area definitely testament diy ethic work record music release label building love earn living yeah try draw inside put record believe touch personally hopefully people catch think ask nowadays u impossible appeal big company put music necessarily mean course people lucky good thing today technology charge stuff production music venue release also decide cd record manufacture could describe work style record track usually one u would make sketch like drum pattern element bassline minimal arrangement two three sound morgan start would bring place vice versa sort trade back forth sometimes start stuff together drum pattern one pattern sort lay whole song even use one instrument sound make change foundation piece music unfortunately electronic music encourages build song one loop especially start sequence tend work way record something loop sound cool might like eventually get tire loop composition morgan hooked dj point early dj college radio spent lot time music direction school station learn mix go school call colgate university upstate new york cold still high school shirt laugh go kind strange school sporty culture much focus art really get music spent lot time like mind people also really music get involve radio finally want get support small record label send record dance show kind record play time like house stuff dance music column college music journal call cmj would read follow tip try get record curious put play list radio station review show encourage people dance show would try throw party school dabble make beat yeah point much make beat economics really play big part either ability inability produce music acquire gear lot easy really need computer sketch really need whole bunch gear back start one sampler korg ds bit piece shit laugh laugh snare ok snare alright yeah split keyboard different place mean get like two key per sound much also ibm pc little monochrome display real old technology laugh crap time though say man sit early sound player ibm pc man time could mix stuff important one first thing sampler sample u beat taped key would repeat played little sound thought ok make music let play music bring try illustrate idea start sort music play record still play lot stuff first get feel like little bit unification history music feel like go lot different sound style abandon subsequently feel like unification history kind cohesive way name label environ yeah well morgan kind come name think mind sort notion music sound create environment atmosphere create mood space think name label environ testament idea put record piece music actually create effective mood atmosphere really change environment way think get first record play environ inspire friend name daniel wang play record right basically sequence much morgan skeletal sequence drum synth played around use roland v digital multi track record computer hard drive accessible ubiquitous already could little expensive buy converter need pretty decent machine use dedicate hardware unit layer sound top would use tape recorder basically glorify multi track tape recorder music metro area atmosphrique drum bassline sequence record clap top record hand clap idea behind sloppiness good know want avoid rigid feel sequence everything want go back spirit old record introduce little bit live feel looseness keyboard part also played quantize mistake good otherwise sound way rigid one thing fight make record already point inspire friend danny wang would stuff like music daniel wang like dream stop dream make sample still loose think something like look drum machine ep balihu first balihu record really interest music quantize electronic groovy big inspiration u work together really mean already hung little bit together studio work together piece music know morgan remix danny find difficult combine extensive dj schedule make music little bit come home gig travel always take time recover get back groove make something especially work piece music many know work maybe step away mind still engage thing work leave town dj gig take away mental world make music challenge part get back home dive back work track moment yeah work remix morgan start new metro area stuff start first start together think first track morgan seed first idea first rhythm feel morgan get first chuckle cool fine next one think licensing issue since tune bootleg always feel like artist compensate properly work credit always give time people deserve know make record author record compensate work also end thing people want particular piece music accessible people take upon provide piece music press illegally without licensing properly buy bootleg record sometimes bootleg like old sought classic time end stick nice example record someone take whole track put vocal another record top play kiss fm new york original track would get played station think great play time know get credit weird spot flattery played necessarily outweigh practical aspect credit compensate would mind someone sample bit one track example snare drum sample snare tune begin kick drum snare drum take little drum sound mind someone sample u use bit drum beat try sample music little drum sound own probably take somewhere else take indirectly take difference promote vinyl cd look totally different product target market yes definitely think vinyl record promote even dj mailouts label make practice others even extent promote vinyl record would run around club sometimes give away record dj like want play stuff really beautiful thing vinyl receive music enthusiast vinyl like commodity people talk play record friend good almost self promote way aspire dj learn experience first foremost people really draw deepest musical fascination thing really appeal musically compromise make foundation fuel good piece music dj feel something people go enthusaism something contagious people feel dj make music really love something people pursue exactly love nothing less go along guideline everything else sort secondary also pay attention quality sound record sound record clear strong statement matter small sound may mean something piece use layer lot stuff together happy make sort dense composition could pull sound make difference retrospect think right way go piece music pull sound sound incomplete yesterday saw give hugh masekela record remixed music wonder could play u actually one thing want talk little bit notion remix issue become apparent work remix hugh masekela song mama people remixing today usually take sample original record whole new track also another approach people use take whole multi track record adjust individual element mean original composition recording still balance different achieve different result maybe couple sound add go original original record treat respect way people use remix past learn remixing track let play original first music hugh masekela mama original track would like play remix let original track run rebalanced sonic result totally different give work whole record drum track trumpet guitar whole multi track record broken instrument different audio file original multi track recording individual audio file cd kind construction work yeah basically put part studio environment line play together maybe volume wrong adjust music hugh masekela mama metro area birthday dub
