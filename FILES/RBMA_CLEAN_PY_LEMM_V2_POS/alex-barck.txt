sonar kollektiv start make ten year anniversary think record label last ten year deserves round applause applause congratulation survive secret survival indie record game easy right would say crazy idea label need much time create music thought meantime actually release people music begin start get people like dj dixon instance take care housier side thing label daniel best best seven dub reggae several mini r team help u discover music probably know daniel less discover fat freddy drop u dixon come âme good people around u secret good music come u big distribution company go bankrupt major problem lot money need cashflow big trouble go bank borrow money stuff several point decide move stop always move probably something love music always something interest new come business point view bit silly sometimes album love music dimlite instance somehow sellable touch see artistic approach come somehow feel even pay earn money music payment well term earn kollektiv music good thing always happy something interest around get label dj perspective lucky enough get promos see product seem like phenomenal output always stuff come mean many people run label keep tempo release time honest would like less release actually right less cashflow thing u happy need put stuff like make structure work four people work u every big territory like uk u australia japan france germany promo agency cost lot money really know earn money record sale sure number record sell make work know pop music successful sometimes invest stuff definitely brings money back immediately long term relationship case make sense think differently big catalog new release also offer old release try make like go around sometimes record sell time like clearly start pretty much everyone contemporary music dj base music buying vinyl fact everyone buying vinyl kind music time lot change someone think start record label traditional sense tomorrow would say always say believe say digital side thing change lot even u vinyl lover would actually put everything vinyl business point view difficult right turnover get vinyl money make vinyl earn money maybe sell possible change little bit strategy people buying vinyl
