guest today sebastian niessen germany munich specific constructor electronic instrument well musician played couple people perform equipment equipment modify various record release also go tour stuff back artist live act synths sequencer stuff select couple tune history electronic equipment picked couple people think influential work well whenever somebody get involve electronic music first major difference play acoustic instrument opportunity choose equipment say ok want steinway piano rather bösendorfer want gibson guitar rather fender choice play guitar play piano pretty much instrument electronic music totally different mean everybody build instrument certainly mean everybody somewhat serious electronic music aspect electronic music even say related dj true certainly true related produce make track make electronic music part training grow electronic musician choose instrument use sure everybody know zillion tool around software hardware kind strange less strange thing use life short probably know many program many different piece hardware thousand maybe ten thousand different piece equipment software could possibly use try express electronic music obviously use make choice use order make choice know little possibility limitation strength weakness various instrument say know always interest understand abstract concept actually get learn program learn machine people start interested electronic music time lot possibility already exist commonplace commonplace look back history electronic music people start electronic music little earlier force design least somebody design equipment simply equipment store could go say hey need hippest sampler hardest drum machine business exist pioneer electronic music design instrument simply necessity anything around get detail work would like talk two pioneer electronic music particularly influential electronic music general work particular one american guy name raymond scott might heard one german guy name oskar sala let start short track raymond scott recordedpurely acoustical music raymond scott quintette microphone music cut splice nothing played like begin end guy brought quintet life raymond scott start swing bandleader early try technique equipment available nevertheless try technique modern remixer like much attitude dj today would would record rehearsal band onto record tape recorder time would cut record every rehearsal would take record back home sit like five gramophone record player needle drop listen various part various track rehearse band since technical way splice would write ok like bar one seventeen track like bar five nine track go back next rehearsal band play track like come pretty successful quintet make quite lot moneywar actually one way make lot money walt disney license track use soundtrack cartoon make money allow pursue major interest beside music electronics start try build design construct instrument would allow go beyond possibility acoustic swing quintet basically war year afterwards spent longer rehearse quintet play swing music sit home solder reason picked one sort influential designer constructor inventor electronic music fascinate sequence early first one actually think sequence another way say player piano sequencer raymond scott try really build machine allow compose music beyond capability human player beyond capability normal acoustic music actually start building machine basically sequencer built relay electromechanical switch take year turn wall rack literally meter foot long two meter high inch rack meter long wall sound call time actually lot stuff ibm time also stuff like spark plug think even like medicine cough medicine cough medicine stuff like everything related science chemistry physic people would get actually underlay commercial electronic music play one really love spark plug car listen sound chose make order visualize spark plug know spark car spark plug commercial think around probably somewhere latelateearlyautolite spark plug commercial music raymond scott manhattan research autolite spark plug use equipment actually make sound spark plug actually spark like tzzz tzzz heard sound time mean could like go anyone say yeah make sound spark plug mean find people actually probably one america time actually capable produce electronic sound time probably first example hear interested create electronic sound also say interested sequence may sound little stupid call bipibip bipibip spark plug sound sequence fact try somewhat automate process create electronic music mean today call sequencer basically sort one first example would actually use would like play another one course lot talk go upfront listen voiceover much listen background ibm commercial also probably something like music raymond scott manhattan research ibm mt st paperwork explosion check sequence background think would agree music without voiceover one would make really cool dance remix loop heard background right say commercial intend club use anything make something completely different thing consider hip modern whatever around even aesthetic around yeah particular interest really program music sense u today computer computer around look machine would allow compose music compose interested use synthesizer even call synthesizer time let use term anyway look machine would imitate something would sound like violin try make sound make music do say begin way could get electronics get solder iron really develop design build stuff would quickly like change pioneer want introduce german guy call oskar sala also born around time raymond scott early th century raymond scott born think sala sure approach little bit different music student berlinplayed piano study composition classical composition classic composer modern classic composer might know call hindemith german jewish composer later emigrate united state obvious reason around bunch people also physic professor berlin university call trautwein guy builtexact opposite raymond scott try raymond scott try say pre program automate music meanwhile oskar sala interested create electronic instrument played physically lot bodywork involve play guitar play piano anything like definitely different alley raymond scott never interested pre program sequencer anything like interested find building design instrument expressive video oskar sala play trautonium think second movie play sort modernize version instrument builtbasically technical concept video oskar sala unknown wire span across metal rod depend position hit control pitch fairly simple since bob moog lot people building controller know ribbon controller allow one advantage disadvantage time learn play learn like fretless bass violin learn hit right note easy thing normal keyboard play vibrato move around play glissando slide thing regular keyboard also play may enough musical training hear stuff heard intone equal temper big difference interval sound little strange ear today use listen equal temper music electronic keyboard buy today basically equal temper start saidplay kind instrument take year probably decade even master instrument control pitch subtly musically also control volume subtly musically may see rod push wire move downwards say probably one strangest design mechanism ever see music try play yeah yeah course look like fool sit audience swedish folk instrument basically string actually play string seem kind pluck string erlend øye yeah pluck string mean course also hit harder like really old grand piano like instrument call spinet whatever like difference string create sound ok use control electronic circuitry control pitch oscillator electronic circuitry would like play spinet basically thing happens like like press hard sound press right come mechanism mention translate pressure voltage could control volume ok machine fix frequency key also envelope anything like way sound shape volume wise like attack fade played played amount pressure put mechanism really need lot rehearsal training spend year thing get sort little bit recognition work last year life people would approach say gee sound great teach learn get would say well tell built one instrument consider electronic musician engineering capability definitely intention say well know work solder iron know thing electronics want electronic composer sure necessarily today anymore people would start sort look instrument try figure would quickly recognize fascination go music physical capability guy developed year hack around string strange instrument today everybody instant gratification meaning want get result want fast people found difficult long would take learn say ok well pas think go buy regular roland whatever actually take stuff concert hall would perform live like piano player would perform stage actually composition play instrument would fill like big concert hall big concert hall time likewell actually fill concert hall already dark time third reich since jewish emigrate manage continue musical work nazi time little strange also necessarily kind music might well happen sort put pressure play something german manage continue work instrument throughout war war fact end one play instrument come mostly fact hard learn take much time understand circuitry understand happen actually manage play musical way sound effect hitchcock bird sound background also produce exact machine saw heard example video alfred hitchcock bird come fun part earlypeople start develop instrument bob moog two week ago start design stuff oskar sala brave enough would almost say ignore equipment come afterwards know never minute thought get moog sort keep technology think personally look back work life think one main reason develop mastership one instrument concentrate waste time reading manual buying new equipment go store bring back box would take month find look ignore completely technical development come start broader basis earlythink show quite character today lot people get electronic music sort start look around use use ok like music buy equipment us like music try get equipment found one instrument like piano player like piano player think buying guitar need pretty much approach think developed skill unique instrument capable produce music nobody else world could ever produce think today generic tool toy gadget disposal one want successful happy electronic musician electronic composer major part life develop something specific develop style course also develop certain type mastery equipment never develop constantly keep buying late stuff instrument pick instrument use major influence music make depend production environment choose whether one dinky little casio keyboard software whether inherit million go bought matter matter use influence style want develop unique style something unique music unique setup mean unique sense built second world mean usually today use one instrument use whole lot box combination box way use box point become unique otherwise one people rest life tempt begin go copy software friend start work order find tool whether software hardware appeal whatever reason reason rational mean instance like certain synthesizer way look like certain synthesizer way feel way knob feel touch dislike others reason look shitty feel good necessarily musical reason would say would look instrument matter finish track see instrument anymore make music something irrational big problem computer computer rational computer always force least rational every ten second every twenty second think menu find certain option think make music make electronic music well non rational thing stay way good want real musician sense word make music something irrational rational reason eat keep warm obviously need obviously need listen music suppose people feel need make music engineer look certain piece equipment say ok do way problem cheaper well businessman say ok sell many thousand concerned make music electronic music concerned find tool allow become intuitive difficult become intuitive computer see people say computer wrong way say use computer tendency music emotional intuitive say constantly switch back rational mode order find right menu submenu compose well totally different story say totally different story classical music may enough well train people capable imagine say string quartet play score without actually hearing least good training classical composer anticipate sound like unfortunately fortunately depend look electronic music case even know lot synthesizer equipment hard anticipate sound like program tweak knob listen make electronic music always sort conversation sort dialogue machinery good interest equipment electronic music equipment talk talk mean thing unexpected
