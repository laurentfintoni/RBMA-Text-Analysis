three day lot go program live percussion jay vocal happen day mix everything else special jay z story share u actually ever get room somewhere else record thing vocal come jay z story single one ok fair engineer mixer producer well time yeah label owner stupidly yes recently start label many many year business yeah regard though think know always think something people realize think think moment mixer seem record industry decide go love produce think really good get many opportunity anymore part label involve record happen label moment mixer fine super portable time flexible come paris mix revision last night hotel answer email airport say hold minute sent produce record room someone else something yeah fine guess love music want band play trumpet work get excite record part make record way band produce closest come band without actually band really drew since get ton mix creatively anyway get guess proper start industry speak assistant engineer work new england electronics well new england digital new england digital sorry assistant engineer normal route back young slightly old route traditional studio route would either go school plenty people argue go school go school go university miami record degree four year music major minor electrical engineering much time studio could possibly get normally would happen get job studio runner maybe eventually assistant maybe engineer would get sick engineer follow traditional career path friend mine work new england digital make synclavier one first digital start fm synthesizer sequencer heard michel jackson earlier weird dong sound begin beat synclavier fm synthesis also developed monophonic sample polyphonic sample even disc record forefront first fairlight waveframe three big player digital audio make music friend mine job say opening l office want field service tech okay actually pay money whereas work studio pay money take gig paid money figure learn something job far tell quite stressful though extremely expensive piece electronics oftentimes call field service guy broken yeah always always one bad job ever thing get call first box cost least everything might spent quarter million dollar broken sit studio cost thousand dollar day sometimes orchestra cost hour sit box work jump van drive across town show try fix cool part though one would ever trust actually fix say stick around take seat go anywhere like oh really sting want hang around yeah yes mr jackson get hang around session runner assistant would never anywhere near successful artist otherwise afford many night hang watch frank zappa edit live show together spare time experience absolutely incredible also get door lot session want field service tech anymore want make record talent program well fix learn run well anybody town become way get back session programmer guess also great come save day everyone like oh wow yeah really angry really happy yeah first record work officially come field service well come pester people met finally guy name john barnes amaze keyboard player played bunch later motown stuff michael jackson stuff amaze keyboard player hire programmer assistant lot engineering also lot program film score work ton record little role get work tour much wife dismay stevie wonder tour keyboard programmer michael jackson tour dangerous tour end work michael jackson history record first full massive record something clean people mean do lot program point first full big time record pretty good way start suppose like work record hundred people though hand weird lot camp work new york eight month think eight month maybe longer work hit factory four studio facility west th st another two studio building couple block away time six studio cut orchestra big studio two room set constantly steve porcaro toto show go engineer good weird float role tie particular room could go hang watch bruce swedien record orchestra go watch steve porcaro program synths go across road watch guy rene put together track hang michael sing get float around little bit pretty cool play one next song band work quite bit year quite relationship red hot chili pepper yeah let play song first talk get meet relationship music red hot chili pepper dani california applause dani california red hot chili pepper yeah number record work second record first one mix second record work interestingly first many year last project do buy vinyl record stadium arcadium completely analog start finish record computer background vocal ran track two track tape machine mixed analog board inch tape vinyl master analog cut happen since happen year beforehand decision band decision band decision yeah band want record way john especially really adamant want make record way time process think think maybe would easy try background vocal like hold get get another track hold john oh think get bounce together track oh hold john let make another slave fly stuff take grant work digitally really really difficult tape also tape nostalgia tape especially people nostalgic never actually use amaze workflow sound great also sound terrible absolutely wrong thing get sound amaze record hear back like oh right tape anyway production much full analog thing idea begin analog digital thing seem like remarkably agnostic yeah care come go deep concept land second say couple time last week feel like start repeat heard yet lot people say well matter come speaker think people tend necessarily believe buy true make record let say lucky enough actually get release normal people buy lucky people buy idea record edit maybe know difference digital analog happen own turntable maybe tenth percent actually would understand say hey check kick drum care make amaze sound record anything great make amaze feel record matter use plenty record early stone stuff beat demo keith cassette recorder put sound terrible matter feel amaze cannot stress enough plenty talk term record make process rest like sheila say happy fun onstage point make record feel amaze people want hear care use fruityloops analog tape matter call fruityloops anymore regardless want know use kick drum one pretty awesome want talk start band actually interest gotten call already work rick rubin work chili pepper yet shame saw play live one best show ever get call somebody vocal anthony also overdubs john go move anthony mix john need someone engineer say come saturday see go know start monday something like plan dinner saturday like okay fine go go couple hour never go couple hour show guy record john overdubs say right man hard drive use microphone get go john twenty minute like heard single song record set hotel room john walk hotel room think met maybe maybe walk living room bedroom vocal mic say right let go like song introduction chili pepper land john particular way record record stadium spent think six week something overdubs john amaze record guitar solo stick mic amp never see idea loud go record terrible square wave solo amaze john like yeah sound great little bright like yeah completely distort matter like part tone point seem like really like band straight band amaze amaze best musician ever work flea play anything still think good two hour hanon piano study every day still feel like want get well piano go back college learn music theory felt like get left behind sometimes conversation meanwhile one badass bass player ever born chad obviously anthony best frontmen ever john josh incredible really lucky like last year write want get write demo would u room record insane band good much fun want time talk flea play piano try get well well get well mixer engineer know suck think good know every hear something do like oh wow actually pretty cool well record arrangement amaze anybody could mixed suppose completely honest feel like okay get something go really think good constantly try learn try well hear stuff people do like oh god ridiculous want find study even necessarily sound specific thing use electronic music neophyte basically like old stuff like musique concréte first heard skrillex sure first crazy drop mix unbelievably loud whatever breathtaking heart would stop second track would slam back like okay make happen make bass sound exactly like eq use hearing inspiration emotionally manipulative mixer really make song explode always go think ever achieve get well suck get well right get bad fair yeah want ask couple technical thing open question general sense notice couple thing talk past one mix box day yeah make decision start analog mackie console actually mixed iggy pop song work move mackie digital console move box make sense really come completely large console stadium arcadium part directive analog thing mix neve point forward mix console could reality mix console disaster term modern workflow song console console literally thousand knob little detented position inch half tall unless stand directly idea point take picture hope okay parallax thing get wrong recall write knob would take hour half get fast would piece paper take console week later put back console knob exactly use anymore plus fact eq broken swap gain structure different power different hotter day everything sound different go console outboard gear explain people like go mix one song time sign song do go okay great call week later say one work last week let turn high hat background vocal next one really feel bass big enough nobody get anymore way record make enough experience work box know okay know also sound great program use lot plug in amaze fill gap term plug in sound like particular piece gear really stuck kind thing decide start make transition make life easy halfway really second guess go lucky enough lunch tchad blake guy know tchad blake one best mixer ever amaze producer well one coolest adventurist mixer ever want hear think one best record record call latin playboy make two record first one self title one make track cassette kitchen one coolest sound record ever make go see pick brain little bit even start talk realize hold second box five year excuse able make work make think almost two year compression love parallel compression yeah almost exclusively explain may know okay everybody know compressor okay good go back far parallel compression set compressor way would set reverb instead put directly something compress version thing put send thing let say kick drum still uncompressed record kick drum send compressor might crush might whatever blend uncompressed signal compress signal call parallel two parallel audio pad around forever back day box great thing box many parallel change want long software take care delay compensation get technical delay compensation cannot work sound phase weird probably get software thing point way use may slightly different lot people compressor kick drum compressor snare drum maybe stereo thing drum kit maybe one bass maybe vocal know thirty one one thing couple set vocal get one kick snare get one drum get stereo one every single thing mix except drum bass copy mix minus drum bass go stereo compressor blend parallel compression versus insert compression put compressor something catch peak turn change shape peak leaf quiet stuff alone blend compressor side bring low stuff change way sound actually leave peak alone peak uncompressed signal go louder anything blending uncompressed snare hit attack kick drum uncompressed vocal carry emotion still blend much compress part want go help louder help consistent sound bit like record balance uncompressed raw excite version share compressor make life easy song mix stereo compressor everything except drum bass vocal really loud turn guitar soon singer stop sing guitar come ride anymore do do compressor hearing alone one blend subtle make everything interact sound much urgent energy like room watch people play also like people play together downbeat six people hit downbeat never hit unless edit make hit time get get sound first guy get turn everybody little bit get messy flam still get ridiculous groove thing always line long answer compression reverb like reverb reverb right seem like use much though use much part work rick rubin twelve year huge fan reverb kind hear way love reverb sound make sound natural big space help build world mix live like obvious effect unless suppose really obvious effect like song reverb stuff love super long reverbs one snare hit cavern something like something grab attention create something within song whole style mix every snare hit like swim pool sound unnatural want hear mixer create want hear want able feel like room whatever go even problem obviously band still drum guitar support voice feel like world room room happens couple turntable drum machine instead drummer bass player much natural thing use reverbs lengthen snare make tom explode little bit solo sound crazy reverb sound natural track distort guitar snare reverb becomes length otherwise snare sound little choked really make thing naturally sound like something unnaturally make sense know mean move question work quite bit rick rubin learn key essential lesson take away work lot little stuff learn part left band overdubs learn produce actually rick thing involve songwriting basic track vocal mix want spend nine hour mess around chorus guitar part feel free check do get guy work chili pepper weezer amaze band hand thing think really big thing always listener say make record people know anything make record way always listens really reinforce fact cool come make excuse turn around say well do drummer feel well nobody care go able go everybody house buy record well actually lot record come could sell four copy three mom go tell mom happen yeah people want know callous mean anything like want hear make record really think great want listen anymore want get behind scene stuff amaze excuse something good matter terrify even really good excuse even fault care couple fault work know sure hundred try block anyone question want yeah right let go hello okay honor u thank time thank would like ask advice mix headphone know general consensus lot u afford acoustic treatment room nice monitor best way go well play phantom first little story music low roar phantom applause want play get lot low end get lot top end entire record mixed headphone assume travel assume get back studio put speaker go fix everything best sound stuff ever do answer first do careful stuff hear sony mdr whatever cheapo headphone bright record drummer actually hear without destroy know listen year think important thing need ton acoustic treatment though able setup speaker important thing mixer speaker listen nothing important long room tiny make work angle across room instead go straight rectangle lean mattress corner bass trap entire room way think big thing want able hear speaker room deader big well small room people spend entire career people way successful mix get new speaker chase whatever use one pair speaker year know matter tannoy matter need something nice bright really hear go headphone match speaker way low end lot feel go headphone want headphone hyped bottom hard find like beat people love way sound never know go low end super process also mix less focus individual thing sound like realize bass kill vocal mean bass right vocal right bass must right nonexistent decide need something interaction thing mix much important individual thing sound anything long hear think natural sound thing find try learn speaker listen ton stuff work know think awesome make sure sound awesome come speaker make mix sound awesome come good little corollary may come idea everything sound good huge learn last year really put practice idea mix couple important thing almost always vocal one kick snare always super important bass one two instrument play body song might song case everything sound good might track stuff absolutely matter stuff sound like never go solo way people know microphone use also go back solo high hat loop see good high hat loop high pass well none matter get core element sound good rest pan find level spend time eqing add effect anything mix way well way way way faster way whether headphone speaker lot less concentrate go every track session say man third acoustic guitar sound awesome put back mix minus pan underneath second acoustic guitar really matter fix hideous problem thing go stuff super important hello follow question regard listen level mix think remember chris lord alge listen really low much low hear hard drive well actual mix low yeah sit people like know tchad actually sound meter sit board make sure always certain level discipline enough think good get use level know thing hit certain way listen really loud really quietly really loud feel thing know good also kid something whatever bad really loud bad really quiet really quiet hear mix whole balance like something stick something way loud hear vocal way kind stuff check quietly two different way listen think ever listen normal volume ever get mix think good make change probably never listen loud super quiet whole time okay thank hi thank advice lot u produce music start finish probably professional involvement would end master stage wonder stuff sound like self release stuff soundcloud miss fundamental mix technique encourage bedroom producer obtain professional service mix stage overlook today lot producer yeah two side technology democratization make record anybody make record amaze somebody might never gotten studio engineer producer actually make record music would never heard otherwise make think idea engineer craftsman much even technology much physic involve electronics involve record really technical job serve creative purpose would love say hire mix stuff money otherwise hire definition word reality hard make argument really think heard lot talk class nyu last week one guy songwriter say yeah get song record really happy think feel good mean sound great feel really great get mixed feel bad like well opposite mix take everything good need happen make happen make happen big way enhances song point much important feel good sound good therefore get stuff feel good need another mixer feel good nobody else agrees well make record idea public like therefore certain standard sonically get threshold people listen really vague concept trust master either would master engineer magic bullet crappy sound feel record seminar week long seminar get people really experienced stuff sound amaze happens lot time song start sound incredible get chorus sound exactly like well okay maybe need make intro first verse sound incredible get chorus explodes kind thing maybe artist know achieve arrangement good get extra instrument come chorus add tambourine work something mixer definitely bring help good would point mixer realize thought already track lay like roadkill chance mixer go able sort chance even small master engineer sort make louder brighter could think craft especially record acoustic instrument experienced engineer definitely something strive experienced producer outside opinion music performance ass vocal really difficult thing many record make without sit tell yes hire engineer producer think collaborate happens experienced engineer great realize shortcoming find somebody bring case point wife hears every single mix send part listens completely like consumer like like work like ugh make crazy always right also idea soon play music somebody else hear differently really important part process get kind reset way listen really easy check cool program get vocal effect second chorus awesome listen song soon somebody else come room immediately ass song way professional collaboration way process least get somebody come reset kind dance around bit thank hi hearing talk use parallel compression like something heard like use much way lot time work people record vocal home whatever get tip like parallel compression one deal vocal sometimes poorly record record harsh way get sit sometimes really big clutter production may produce obviously every track totally different vocal harsh get get rid harsh frequency period either notch filter sits somewhere ½ k range hurt little creative use either multiband compressor one favorite thing use active equalizer different one mcdsp ae think basically like pay somebody hang eq every time certain frequency get control dip much less invasive way sonically deal dynamic example vocal superbly record jake bugg record mixed sings quietly full open sound voice sings loud get nasal close nature voice nothing wrong sudden get frequency kill rather automate eq spend three hour found frequency seek destroy vocal get super loud one frequency stay get turn get deal deficiency sound voice first do think find subtle effect work slap delay short delay filter pop thicken vocal way little pitch shift go like plus nine cent one side minus nine short delay sudden vocal go way short reverb short plate ambience type reverb sudden gotten vocal use like world see world instrument still poke d depth lend back track thanks hi man thank thank get question regard visual stuff mixdown much work happen visual base like spectrometer none really yeah look meter care mix super super loud know nature way mix come together parallel compression thing like always end around level level know loud master engineer complain think make life easy need transfer yeah absolutely idea mix something back still console bob ludwig master respect whatever genius one people invent master way call say hey man know mix plus like plus even talk well send one without limiter well limiter mean limiter know push console feel good mix crazy loud really ever look anything people though personally think one problem especially look spectrum analyzer thing like kid spent time fortunately develop plug wave eq development time über geek try get work do really care eq sound like try model band eq neve thing something else look exactly audio precision version spectrum analyzer look exactly sound right put snare drum nope sound way well found bother put low pas k high pas hz get go transformer nothing eq circuit input box soon put k sound right make sense time think unless try find problem buildup frequency try find get rid point know frequency stuff happen way interacts always make sense right thank ever look thing stop never even start mean know analog day look meter print thing tape proper level problem come desk hot uncal tape machine crank input like db turn mix sound good okay left uncaled tape machine would fit yeah look look something go break level good get figure chain bring never bring case always bring level never never look anything else hi first thank big inspiration mix wise especially year ago stumble upon new artist soundcloud jai paul put song call jasmine heard song okay much okay question sorry okay mix stuff would say unconventionally put much sidechaining hardly hear actually say know back day get lot harsh criticism actually make intimate sound stage every day hear new soundcloud artist copying do extent get lot people say mix way loud mix know want hear extent think listen someone actually technically school follow intuition feel intuitive person listen right right way never right would unhappy change wrong like say person planet like mix come term idea music business thing lot people like idea music thing like decide want live much much happier producer make record gogol bordello duke spirit love band love record nearly well record care case go listen people something say always worth investigate someone say something unless want pick master engineer sometimes master engineer look meter tell something loud well whatever find different master engineer point seriously find somebody like mix start think always worth try figure react decide whether something mind change sudden still like get people like whether something destroys love happens micro sense time like oh really want hear shaker louder okay go mess groover get try find entire way music terrible like well okay give much go give specific see think important humble enough listen criticism decide whether anything hopefully silently arrogant enough say art go destroyed really easy become arrogant enough say even go listen say like difficult take criticism sometimes important crawl back hole try figure criticism actually see way fix maybe learn something process way sometimes people dick ignore thank much hi mix reason like ssl emulator actually mess faders generally keep zero tweak gain maybe actual instrument output know maybe get little bit difference maybe move half decibel decibel get kind range terrible protocol long understand signal flow get go line trim actually emulate ssl first thing happens fader last thing happens want less level go insert compressor turn line trim fine think sound awesome loud want line trim change sound make less go compressor turn fader right wrong way still sound great realize go affect thing really important know pre post signal flow get go especially sidechaining share parallel compression something like change one spot affect certain thing change affect everything always find reason least mix gain always less profound effect fader always seem really mess well totally find fader exaggerated could get subtlety tweak gain yeah work work absolutely cool go go somebody house explain use line trim hey mixer influential sound music business say sound like create expectation talk decide artistic point view decide expect something sound feel responsible could change whole way listen certain type music ever think macro sense like think every mix encapsulate thing sometimes spread whole album something mix far hear big louder deeper d excite version artist gotten start mix sometimes like low roar stuff lot input lot modular synth program make decision arrangement thing like time make musical decision way unless really hear something inspire feel would make song lot well carry forward think anything particular opportunity anything particular make record make artist record lucky name back usually bury inside age mean feel like power anything like also feel like responsibility talk whole thing know metallica record mixed everybody say way loud figure loudness war care hear track record somebody iphone speaker laptop speaker sound excite hell job do point suppose aggressive excite record exactly mechanic thing get clipped whatever get plenty could say irrelevant matter yeah would never give responsibility though think like oh face ear music come way much think get criticism around metallica record death threat literally pull back really want go everybody involve record heard record say awesome thing make controversy much much bad one person involve process understand one person internet respond somebody try explain away role threw people bus make specific mostly say yes problem record everybody else involve like well record make yeah guess curious specific record guess curious process think criticism adulation outside ever affected preordain go mix control mix time mix finally get chorus work realize wow kind blown bring back chorus work like really wish could find way thing make compromise point chorus still work square wave mix mix come much song arrangement record performance thing change completely song song little bit even record one song amazingly easy mix another one ridiculously difficult thing point say come together well thing take forward figure something mix add template oh work maybe work term big overarch concept mix anyway many record one two song obviously people mix song process like term get consistent talk like process talk artist ensure everything whole come together well job job mix song get think time say oh mix couple time brought late project mix two track feel like get person mixed thrown master master guy oh sound different make work like thought job okay whatever really thing master bad experience couple master guy absolutely love eric boulanger use work master lab network get place call bakery l chris bellman bernie grundman amaze like send mix get criticism know screw absolutely revisit mix address whatever hearing wrong time like man awesome like great okay get somebody hears thing way hear thing master become weird nebulous area voodoo magic yeah sorry couple bad experience come rush back go ahead hello lot u produce stuff mix everything produce make something obviously mix mix end do make something mess process thing co produce go back mix set everything back zero compare record get everything input go mix oppose something co produce whole time produce record especially live record say gogol bordello record particular eight people play live tracked record live band two song day include overdubs except vocal quick completely performance case track live band playback completely flat single eq single compressor assess get awesome awesome let record differently get well take change guitar amp something like want manipulation fooling actually get produce mix time mix low roar stuff song played label headphone much production progress mix happen go mixed record take even though involve mix stage say okay start mix course exactly mix something come someone else mix usually keep everything already go pretend tracked way way modern production instead track stylize way song everything get tracked incredibly simply microphone straight computer get mess later however come everybody hearing say do time mix something could balance sonically whatever want sonically might really stylize specific case make record version already like mix stage thing rarely strip everything song start waste time call black boxing pretend get stuff already do real problem rather try fix fact see undo make problem dive back generally like oh way song go make do gripe thing deliver way would like thing deliver get set mix something really easy say everybody spend lot money go studio record reality stuff stuff bother song terrible arrangement bad performance bad bug mix song happen couple time bass verse really cool thing bass verse song feel terrible bass verse becomes process actually played bass verse send note producer artist like hey know happen song bass verse felt like would much well bass verse need b chorus becomes whole apologize finish song reaction oh awesome great yeah probably do yes do stuff drive crazy lazy instead say song do awesome let get mixed sick work let send andrew see happens like fuck whole level involvement sometimes incredibly great really inspire creative fun kind thing hire mix say would cheap want right away get really annoyed obviously get rock record mix drum record living room really sound like make angry make sad know much record explode speaker instead go like little m toilet something like living room put drum trick would suggest yeah deaden wall go people place record drum establish band band always do get drum kit setup living room narrow living room one instance kit width room cymbal four inch away either wall plaster wall like hey get pack blanket rug could hang like oh wow awesome idea deaden room like say speaker always setup straight room set across room way microphone sit right middle stand wave set kick drum harder path substitute good sound kit good drummer matter start use microphone actually concentrate really easy put thirty microphone drum kit say ah sound somewhere sound terrible happen gotten many track like would rather four mics really railroad sound like particular way sound particular way yeah kit drummer important thing vocal term mean record great place yeah mistake go really small room big room big live room like big wood floor brick plaster wall want dead really unless go effect hive get far mic distort amp something like normal vocal want sound microphone want sound vocal bounce ceiling microphone wall microphone window microphone make thing sound messy distant far away drier well dead room also big room even room feel dead microphone feel dead feel phase weird slap echo yeah also make sure right mic vocalist theory right mic different thing voice varied sound source anything ever record time need really expensive mic time sm thing every u record every single vocal sm control room one iconic rock singer around need get good vocal sound excuse get good vocal sound cheap microphone question hey like two mini question add one normal size question yeah yeah cool math mix left center right exclusively put gradation neve console mixed left center right physical reason button left speaker button right speaker put center want pan anywhere actually switch pan circuit resistor ear aside drop level little bit sound good try avoid much could box pan stuff place ok glad two question somehow go together approach mix box compare mix console really go past zero oppose plus drive console pretty hard really computer well printing mix back computer still limit big voltage get console would put plus interface align minus bring mix db fit back pro tool anyway actually infinite headroom pro tool logic believe cubase know reason know ableton float point mixer get technical instead normal encode record something bit bit thing value correspond voltage maximum voltage describe number float point start use exponent describe number db loud voltage manage turn point get converter remembers use become square live way actually way headroom box ever console turn mix last gain stage recapture wave form would clipped print loud mess go see without change sound mix much push much start sound bad really great tool want get technical pro tool get stereo bus get whole mix get whatever plug in get mix make master fader bus recover peak mess fader anytime mix sound exactly completely change level mix right thank luisa puterman hey curious mix dvd mix surround configuration like do couple thing surround personally unless live show see point unless production do record listen two speaker necessarily enough instrument fill space like say earlier really feel strongly especially live musician understand room begin mix thing make sense song really acoustic song start one acoustic guitar second verse second acoustic guitar player come actually like begin song hear chair creak side guy even go play minute half come already knew exists musician room would think easy think much difficult nobody listener sits middle band music think good idea actually think bad idea also many people home theater okay know go sit screen music suppose five identical speaker room five identical speaker surround setup home sits spot every time listen music move around stereo recover walk around room also like heard steely dan mix shaker part rear right speaker first know shaker song stereo mix blend underneath high hat make sound awesome really annoyed shaker player sit behind groove go completely go talk much get exact education work listen mono stereo version lot beatles record room stereo version state release england mono release state need something different france know release maybe mono whatever early record get stuff left stuff right pan pot nothing middle listen doc robert lady madonna mono version band involve completely different stereo version lady madonna groove like hip hop track mono version ridiculous bass kick piano go together practically make something feel like loop stereo version stuff split sound like honky tonk song totally different song never like lady madonna heard mono version take wrap three speaker subwoofer nowhere near middle anyway enough say luisa puterman sorry another question something say mix orchestra way luisa puterman know secret know one thing treat every mix exactly really obviously end along way make want could totally different method work box completely different console term order thing use thing try make excite say mixed classical record composer new york sara snider amaze work full orchestra seven solo voice choir sound design ton percussion hundred track make work really become obviously specific thing sara okay really need second oboe come support line echo lot compositional thing important thing really important kick as exact way problem thing start like voice come want listen music support voice super excite super loud probably loud classical record year percussion badass exact parallel compression would put rock drum kit job impact power size depth think really important specific microphone away orchestra good performance try really lean oppose try take bunch spot mics make recreate space orchestra specifically think big thing let try something totally different would mix something else luisa puterman thanks get question yeah noash heark hey question stereo image go super mono track like right face want widen know mention detuning short delay earlier anything else yeah short delay short reverbs pitch shift thing like guitar solo work great long go far enough start sound chorus sudden stuff come speaker key stuff though want listen like do go back want listen balance mix want feel like wait minute yet stuff take go blink feel like shove tiny little hole put stuff back like oh right yeah yeah stuff soon start hear though think start gimmicky sometimes would well obviously vocal necessarily sometimes well take thing center put side nothing wrong guitar solo side feel like band sabbath record mixed two guitar one live one overdub every basic layout record live guitarist pan left start solo guy played solo make sense move middle talk quite bit least philosophy want hear band live band want hear people play lot people electronic producer necessarily point something strive do work surreal rather realistic yeah entire low roar record song feel like band lot program like track kick hat cymbal stack snare drum one tom fill entire record way put together obviously problem think say band people try get something across try excite sheila play every night either see hear smile good time see shred idea lean forward parallel compression make thing sound like lean forward energy would get people perform music absolutely loop program loop program sit super excite placement time groove way sound way interacts yeah think band generic term whoever play band applies classical record much problem much chili pepper actual band get specific musician certain part sound stage make sense think listener feel like hang chili pepper bad thing fact sound like super excite happy play song point make anything question real point know anybody make record suppose boring go dxheaven hey sorry one feel need sometimes fill bass part something like stage mixer draw line embrace crappy drum sound record living room part production move add kick sample even play bass part find balance well get mix do deliver something suck whatever take threshold much track directly proportional inversely proportional much pain as people honest really like people mix feel respect whatever even see do something really help track much less inclined get people appreciative collaboration really whatever take say mix sound terrible hope like say gig threshold go go stuff unhappy stuff happy dxheaven yeah okay lot gig turn maybe work people past heard something like want touch turn whole lot reality economics record industry nobody money remember set threshold thing like well really work less song month later take half money thing really ever part turn gig pain as thing absolutely plenty artist myopic weird crazy vision come creative place willing sixty revision mix realize sometimes like get know sometimes finish want control remember project time somebody actually let slip felt sense power make mix revision nothing whether mix need revision felt like make andrew scheps make change mix go kind people want work money small super easy turn like go make much difference life someone offer million dollar allow total pain as work couple year take economics really think important thing work music actually like find something like love kind thing work tell anybody work mixed barry manilow record mix record somebody sound like barry manilow mixed actual record barry manilow something nothing would ever listen really interest process fine like music good job impossible really artist think way take relate last answer would like play one song picked maybe talk little bit music room one adele music adele love song applause adele love song talk little bit song mix yeah first fact cure cover awesome bossa nova cure cover even well mixed seven song record use four think go strange do like mix shootout different record rick produce apparently shootout get gig sure work mix shootout know mix shootout several people mix song artist artist chooses mixer go say anyway say oh well get time free want mix adele stuff tracked like okay really know anything think last song mixed well look obviously talented everybody love kept say wish would stop yell get chorus voice powerful loud mix mix much room super super loud kill mix record think metallica sabbath would really difficult get song hey yell remember tell come listen one also nothing sound well people play instrument quietly much tone air track feel huge finally something felt like could play al schmitt kick room like oh andrew suck much anymore whatever love mix love quiet love way sings intimate vocal without ever get work song simple mix neve probably automation doubt wider track maybe use three four parallel compressor maybe couple eq like nothing nothing mix know think like question hi thank conversation couple friend also mix mix sometimes people love find lonely sometimes especially age get sent stuff online sometimes whole lot contact point luxury city artist band time people come check stuff normal process obviously change lot console get studio otherwise listen never get mix do actually like people come first hate people true nosy people totally way mix evolve first never mix one song time go mix whole record somebody start least three song hear anything get first three do reason behind first get well sense record actually work song listen whole record full rough work one song really get spirit album reason one three might completely mark first song think oh hire wrong guy way get two go close lucky three completely miss one go okay come back later worry two tweak little thing let move mix entire rest record specific process really matter mean constantly work lot mix love send mix whoever need approve big thing like say million time care use kick drum refuse let drummer care use kick drum none business like sound kick drum exactly business like job make like drummer kick need mean job need sound good mix old school studio lot outboard gear band come like hey use bass oh guy put bass turn guy suck every piece gear use taint forevermore like people listen use listen hopefully last listen rough mix hopefully destroyed rough mix use hearing song certain spot sudden mix come tear speaker usually pretty excite big thing objective make comment hearing important thing say depend album complicate make perfect sense come would end would actually always want get least one round mix note remotely like ziggy marley record come spent think one day tweaked every single mix record arrangement stuff want actually sure percussion thing hey song get turn guitar chorus song open five minute heavy album mixed exactly thing spent week go back forth hung room afternoon finish mix people way actually finish hard time describe want tell one thing turn nothing something else good get room think really good get multiple thing work way go rabbit hole band want room entire time mixed one song want three day like guy insane talk mix send give comment would come mix sent page comment address comment sent second mix show next day spent ½ six hour tweak one song okay get do print everybody happy hour half later email show two page note go make less pain arse want finish want finish even start mix like way print guitar leslie slow fast see want use like wait wait wait wait wait rough mix song okay guy ready mix get get point least rough mix go mix want give production credit three point choose leslie every guitar make choice come back second guess choice okay start next week take three day rough mix many decision make well sound like work file problem get lot decision make do come right still ten revision mix usually page page note say amaze do except everything bummer yeah thank thank question well guess stop thank much andrew scheps thank
