solo part concerto call cadenza soloist freeform variation whatever want instrument follow cadenza usual feature soloist virtuoso technique basically follow form cadenza basically solo part piece first movement though two part

play note turntable become trombone

right

feel note

practice seriously melodic begin take month practice mean sound simple coordination spot indicate pitch control turntable half tone hear orchestra hall precise take practice dedadada show melody turntable take practice whole different type approach play turntable accurate even explain play violin violin accurate instrument tune tricky violin player incredible ear able play along take practice even stress enough hard play cause violin complex instrument pretty simple compare violin able follow along take mentally spot every note

real sign note sign

right feel good feel able correct quickly practice enough exactly everythings

trombone slide trombone

right exactly create little gap note depend sound cause start dsound versus start b

choose note start

piece call tonal center orchestra piece tonal center sound use press different sound main sound press have give range g octave able note play around note press press different sound different note trial error able range may put pitch control way right note may little flat plan limitation sound use everything long arrange plan may need go another groove extra two three note trial error fun able figure turntable fit within orchestra music try different different environment arrangement orchestra piece piece write multiple turntable piece quartet do little jazz trio play drummer band soloist trumpet player go back forth play hammond b player real structure jazz style play different time signature cool cool orchestra music jazz instead everything hip hop house music always challenge play time signature jazz musician count always count think even play half time may play slow think fast

piece play many part write turntable score many staves turntable cause hard distinguish think hear turntable curious

first part want hide within violin want sound violin sense want hide within melody main melody hear turntable turntable two staves top part fader hand 2 staff nonpitched rhythm percussion score percussion look bottom stave first stave pitch sound treble clef put treble clef score piano piano music take type play piano cause hand hand rhythm em pitch indicate fader hand

loop perform two line composition turntable

right two staves

okay cool

show turntable score computer hard see write write note score first th note two way say actually note have pretend nonpitched scratch call baby scratch demonstrate baby scratch pretend nonpitched pretend have yet rhythm eeee perform notate scratch pretty much actually th note add erase try one say note c want opposite notate low half score say long note long note say sound c pretend c bottom staff see crossfader see hand ot let note play c pretend c play sound crossfader play th note now opposite cause remember hand th note now fader will th note eeee demonstrate crossfader movement first bar eeee hand crossfader unlimited combination triplet crab scratch general term music triplet demonstrate crab scratch triplet basically crab note turn note turn three click whole combination right triplet three note crab triplet start crossfader actually start pitch combination instead learn play whole note demonstrate crab fader whilst move record back forth needle different combination unlimited combination write musical term real basic get complex depend write crazy however fast play pretty much anything cool sometimes give pitch part play play note horrible sound record lose plane even play

problem

basically turntable right whole octave half range sing major scale variation note unlimited sing melody whilst scratch unlimited however write perform write partner jazz piano player actually play part real simple actually play right along call response still experiment endless forever ever stop think great world able make musical communicate musician able play play cool

first think absolutely amaze push whole turntablism beyond wick wick wick

right

great question pro tool mix everything think idea find may part go oh screw part go back redo interest perform live sound complicate

right notation sketch set stone still protools freeform write solo part head qbert talk scratch impression scratch mouth whole communication device mouth bizarre write great solo part come scratch sometimes solo notation suppose set stone rough structure forget

find multiple take different part

oh sometimes rhythm work swing little bite shift little perform little different think notation suppose wide open open interpretation always part score slash mark jazz music slash mark mean improvise part instrument stay key put slash mark let whatever give orchestra freedom able cause change orchestra music whole think go school play great piece mozart piece beethoven bach learn piece play em exactly write write music interpret freeform whatever hear ornette coleman say grandfather freeform jazz create freeform term freeform able freeform instrument whole orchestra let whatever basically think pretty cool think limit everything see balance everything notation suppose tool map okay see everything work forget

think cool keep freeform stance cause scratch come think make original instrument

right

rather always read music scratch dj evolve much box sheet front

right

nice balance create interest approach record ultimate goal scenario maybe full orchestra turntablists come mix real orchestra ultimate dream stage

many different project many different avenue depend project every project goal think always goal everything whole orchestra begin think impossible young first start think way ever able take good ten year ultimate want play orchestra amaze experience musically overwhelm tell first perform orchestra back home powerful experience first people auditorium good hall unite state orchestra able first person first person play hall cause grow orchestra big deal pretty emotional experience powerful able play musician hear sonically hear orchestra music real have audience hear sprinkle place hear melody throughout woodwind violin back viola indicate stereo position hand amaze experience stage come together amaze think dream actually perform never sink day amaze experience

imagine cause dj many people usually stage normally even team turntablist may four guy maximum orchestra texture low high

huge orchestra hall hear orchestra music cause dynamic hear everything clean orchestra stage snap finger hear sound go pppppf impersonate sound reverb weird sound travel hall audio experience hear cd different have have music definitely experience far production try capture piece studio record orchestra lot trick make sound orchestra think have always think way pan violin see stage pan bass little bite horn tuba show hand pan little bite fun cause surround start move around speaker much work always much piece 2 movement think putting speaker balcony quadraphonic show switch mixer send melody around whole orchestra crowd have speaker right take top endless every project different far record go hard capture gear performance composition work gear live performance think tnem stage hard translate studio environment surround sound capture pretty good sample constantly learn never stop learn try convert live recording think artist balance able capture cd good capture live whole perform live record guess different every project

wonder idea improve typical turntable mixer setup play melody think great button play

definitely piano think melody think great idea expensive make change believe stupid right hold turntable pitch control probably cost € manufacture produce expensive make change turntable love make million change work right now turntable perform actually make modification turntable right take 2 pitch catch go actually tweak electronic little bite spot go right move pitch control right right have right c constantly make modification cause tight mean technology already influence dj much remember back day lucky even work crossfader crossfaders staticy work right button fly break time old mixer old jazzy jeff mixer huge landmark turntable production actually make mixer design scratch tool good tool good think always evolve mean idea turntable work hard expensive
