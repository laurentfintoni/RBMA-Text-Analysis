story genesis tell us music musician

tell damn letput swap cd around gonna play open two section anybody wanna look score pass score start begin
music music musician

pass question floor shortly
difference performance piece record
piece record want

redo take splice eq reverb usual trick

nothing specific way miced

okay okay good question rasp bass clarinet make sound mic
wrong way way mic clarinet classically speak bflat
go barrel bass clarinet probably bass
clarinet look make long straight line hand rest floor tend come barrel
mic effect rasp go right
barrel wrong eflat ouch
go barrel bass rasp turn
high frequency low frequency maybe little bite
k make sure bite everything everything else pretty much
normal mics judy
sherman producer classically speak grammywinning wonderful ear
around corner
protools first record
ecm obviously analog still pop studio paris probably track studer day beatles sgt pepper four track stick nose man
score back oh someone else look fine
give end walk
preview leave make sure leave let leave

will come back worry anyone question

balance idea musicality sound several
guest different opinion use idea incorporate music say
make listenable say stick idea closely
possible regardless audience expect balance

write music alone room criterion love
hope will fortunate god know think
way write jingle perfectly valid satisfy customer send back respect craftsmanship
write film etc etc art composition
whatever say fortunate operate field basically
work people smart intuitively smart music fool em think wanna hear smell rat

early mention notate music music
someone classically train possible
composition

good question first various degree able
read sometimes follow score couldnsing line
see shape follow son rock n roll musician
first protools music change work
guitar everything guitar first protools
see eye become involve addition ear think
protools maybe program familiar program show guitar play drum
play suddenly change perspective think work program see music therefore
compose insofar use tool arrange
generally use software

fruityloops cubase

cubase represent music graphically

yes

sense use notation staff notation precise isn t
global picture mean look screen see wow
shrink see whole piece screen detail
work
sibelius pretty
much standard issue finale use sibelius seem easy learn basic music notation friend book
simplify version sibelius question whether s
gonna useful answer speak
someone fluent film composer anyone friendly speak candidly see
gonna help illusion answer

phase effect seem pretty much audio illusion
right term

havendone phase piece since uh year

also say mic clarinet wrong way certain sound
seem limitation interest talk electronic
musician prefer analog talk whether
certain sound incorrect much bass
find software doesn kind quirk error
clear

entire arsenal equipment stage game macbook pro
sibelius reason software sampler use anything reason
except nnxt sampler stack
fill musical instrument now gonna work piece speech
sample sample
sample trigger separate staff sibelius hit separate
miditrack reason fill certain phrase check
city life airbreaks word
sampler trigger notation program piece
software somebody give want able equivalent sound
stopaction film someone say zero go zeroooooo hold note idea deep voice darth vader now
understand call granular synthesis
program originate paris filter mac
friend mine put front end locate
stop voice instance consonant see
fissssssssssssssssssssh fantastic job use also use little
record program call think wiretap make ambrosia basically will take anything mac will dial come safari
mac basic sound record lossless edit
standard apple use graphic equalizer reverb leave
production make mockup sample work
wanna waste much time studio
kind budget adjustingthose spend time adjust will
trim make midimockups will live
composition make sound good will send
performer performer use play along
come rehearsal two three rehearsal road
play tempo context forth entire
involvement mention

mention work piece

early day introduce music people
describe ask describe

have nasty say say think
important journalist will invent somehow
red bull interview online hear real short go paris dig debussy
tap shoulder have excuse moi monsieur est que vous un
impressioniste merde doesnmatter mightsaid think phil glass say
repetitive music say minimal
hand good trance
journalist say say okay musician say say hey man wash mouth soap job write next piece s
job happen job put
box say minimalist bore stupid self
destructive worry next piece sound
good onto next someone else s
job polite make enemy
think major concern musician producer music need worry

time couple question think

hope take us process sit room alone start write much trial error much throw
hear point head address
solitary process go much change now
computer screen front

oh boy good series question couple piece
orchestra far good work need first
violin second fat bad orchestration
learn late basically
since begin little break middle invent
ensemble write inspiration lie wow six
piano four
organ whatever group be
write even write different train string
quartet three string quartet maybe four prerecord
sound triple quartet string quartet miss
identical pair instrument 2 viola 2
cello inspiration simply line instrument
get page say okay write exhale
music musician rhythmic melodic pattern
start instance phone tap finger book hm may good idea drum pattern
form different note different tempo
hour start music musician say sit work harmonically sit piano work series
chord way composer jazz musician may paul mccartney may
work piece encourage continue
start harmonic superstructure basic basic take
maybe half page notebook computer music notebook use
conjunction multitrack tape first work stereo
back forth sound sound always work real sound
always hear mock wasn figure
piano try work head cripple man
hear various way
grant tascam first start teac tascam invent
basically create scully
track halfinch weigh ton transfer
electronic work music musician probably
another ten year point midi appear
scene different train do mac plus notation do
call professional composer
complete lie crash every second export
performer t
mean performer
mean performer play back mock transfer
sample performer lot bandaids chew gum
piece never do without computer
early day still idea piano work
harmonic framework different train work
speech piece people speak flat speak go
computer change pitch three tale
different train cave subject matter think serious enough feel wrong mess around
voice freedom choose want change
else change tempo key every
second have never do workout help invent harmonic movement never come
intuitively try follow word make sense
record speech piece hang onto horse dear life try keep
control right go back work instrumental
piece music organize harmonically piano first
organization do piano music notebook pretty
much intuitive process do computer play back
first sample
cell now
reason somehow play back notation garbage trashcan runneth
write gesture throw away burn firewire harddrives

time couple question

continue discussion write process advise
participant move song symphony long work
visualize long work music musician component part

first never advise radiohead stephen sondheim write
symphony certain wellknown pop people try usually
disaster genius anybody doesnrecognize
deaf ain firm believer first question
bother unless burn hole burn hole
look may mean music school may mean
skill term notation wanna write
musical instrument notation
skill idea range instrument s
good go music school lot performer e
conservatory rather college instead talk
able go cafeteria lunchtime write
string quartet able play play
open string close string forth practical
knowledge big decide reallyneed go

sure embark laborious timeconsuming
period year

anyone else question burn ask

relevant still weird state
piece play emotion maybe english
express word singer good communicate
voice hard express type music s
random think question wonder much use
concept limitation creativity since have
realize concept feel
feel energy whoever create drive creation
piece music much let depend particular moment
time place much try communicate certain message

much follow emotion much follow concept

much improviser think describe improvisation
improvisation ancient honor tradition johann sebastian bach
know great composer day know great
improviser day people afraid organ match re
talk real participate part world
ancient real
work pursue composition imply already
certain amount think go bedrock anything have
ever do rest musical intuition whatever idea may forth test
sound monday sound tuesday sound next
month keep sound good keep sound good good
good thank come
appreciate
