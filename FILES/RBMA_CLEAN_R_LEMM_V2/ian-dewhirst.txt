bottle northern soul hit also jazzfunk record also rare groove sorta

funny take quite bite pride fact northern soul scene scene england play record import come wasn champion south anyone go northern soul load clothcaps dance barn actually guy find gilscott heron george benson cut edge whatever happen contemporary new york also happen north england time

tell us progression different genre
mastercuts series break genre essential build block

series begin point have accumulate year djing across whole numb scene northern scene disco scene jazzfunk scene mix break england round early mix salsoul prelude new york late early even early hiphop early house cd become
popular point werenmany decent compilation especially genrebased one
bite luck time look idea think record incredible resource dj last year let fiddle around let mess want concentrate different genre classic mellow slow jazzfunk obviously jazzfunk disco salsoul funk pfunk electro
suddenly realize quite easy record literally spend good part three week collection pull different genre putting pile think order want try balance right way series design educate also put people balance album think carefully
instance jazz funk vol locate look cd kick expansion lonnie listonsmith pretty much pinnacle jazzfunk always ronnie law another staple bottle gil scottheron say big rare groove scene generally wellknown much good donald byrd wilton felder johnny hammond eddie henderson harvey mason dizzy gillespie pretty solid name everybody buy album like end nontv compilation pretty incredible

go store see compilation
educational deep djing collect have see
lie build block different genre also hook think original turn far information quickly lead quickly thin pocket

yes fault funny start putting uk record dealer say kill market opposite happen people buy cd realize dizzy gillespie price rocket intend think good position utilize experience try pass benefit people werenaround early mid particular period album design thank lord manage achieve exactly say provide foundation people weren sure jazzfunk buy buy classic jazzfunk good time make check area point push brand name
also vinyl metallic pantone sleeve logo emboss vinyl dj friendly three track per side good fidelity try deliver suppose expensive box chocolate sort musical selection eventually manage career high point way

say folk may opportunity track license different compilation somebody sort wisdom impart side also tell process

right okay think lecture listen music business never change right must legal representation okay numb piece advice give anyone even format change fact matter hate say music business steep tradition rip artist quite honest rip certainly take advantage
suppose key always bite bargain process aspire young musician must seem attractive sign major record label swing roundabout involve may give couple hundred thousand quid think oh lovely win struggle anymore buy rest will pay back make mistake rest okay limos deliver house take party party chargeable
think probably good happen music business moment fact think empower artist fact charge destiny term revolution moment now theoretically need record company actually bypass
license point view whole discussion easy license track also decline market moment hopefully bottom hopefully cd will hold business model haven think yet have see version mastercuts

think valuable even lecture do two week putting context music available theory job compilation discussion putting everything context help understand come connection invaluable

think compiler kind different market day cd sale aren use way give guy twohour radio show exclusive hear vintage groove show key track different genre day design compilation sell supermarket old day use lot indie shop virgin hmv day enough
target compilation wide audience always balance act instance funk have keb darge territory putting lot rare someone casually purchase supermarket x amount track fairly commercial proposition try balance instance average white band pick piece labelle lady marmalade sly family stone family affair curtis mayfield freddiedead intersperse lesser know one touch wood seem work

sort manage work r shape sensibility capitol right

yes dovetail r start promotion guy club promotion move london gig emi emi stay company presence club need wheel
someone start promote properly basically result six night week use pay go good job
first month emi bite worry submit expense ask around see much claim say whatever spend add come £ four week submit claim £ expense bite nervous pass expense form hour late shout bossoffice dewhirst ass now shut door think oh ass kick hold expense sheet say hell say look sorry new job go six night week say three time much think job properly unless £ month oh glory day couldnspend ridiculous deliberately stay hotel buy drink whole club result studio time connect network dj
pet shop boy presume probably hear come sign emi literally know original version bobby o version west end girl play ibiza back also record come half 2 uk come epic sudden disappear nobody quite know happen copy go ibiza hear come back start hammer record time pet shop boy drop epic
happen publicist pr girloffice see cassette desk say pet shop boy west end girl course already version west end girl say susie girl say different version say oh hear put think numb record immediately run r department say sign band look crazy hear track rest history west end girl also promote make sure everything work nicely
also jump bite work island good example sign group call wild bunch much credible rap act uk time mainly nellee hooper nellee hooper serious intense young guy know insist deal insist howie b master want go new york supervise although wild bunch release th b way ahead time problem two year ahead time group mutate massive attack soul ii soul nellee hoopergone international producer u madonna etc happen organically
think mean even toronto til early last week way play fairly honest passionate passion major witness week go far wrong bite good financially happy

charge salsoul reissue early

couple put context five year run company call simply vinyl reissue lot rock pop classic gm vinyl release market start slow go back first love salsoul archetypical numb disco label time repackage series somewhere around cd release reissue nice involve buy year previously

get back aesthetic catalog stand term songwriting arrange everything value song

guess good demonstrate business first place influence song hear grow have people focus art arrange get lazy last year easy computer keyboard imagine play everything miss awful nuance individual instrument clever arrange okay guy have play couple song illustrate point pretty good example top top songwriting arrangement prowess win good frankly brill build new york burt bacharach hal david dionne warwick

music bobbie gentry ode billie joe
beautiful little bite everything actually social commentary mean songactually illegal abortion right simple instrumentation deadly effective arrangement string
basically soul black music aficionado doesnmatter area music come bobbie gentry country western singer example unfortunately haven time play become little bother particular genre musicgood good
have give another example particularly record stoner mentality also another perfect example fusion band war early career black hispanic musician eric burdon newcastle uk rock star animal another example great arrangement lovely lyric general nice ambiance spill wine
music eric burdon war spill wine
stoner anthem think much lyric think eric live san francisco time do bite experiment happy accident end la discover war remember come play isle wight festival roy carr new musical express say great band have ever see entire life little move guess beauty music happen organically good example two different mesh beautifully

absolutely salsoul think new york ethic guy around latin music business mid like salsoul strong r artist repertoire serious use people top game majority recording do sigma sound philadelphia use salsoul orchestra also mfsb use gamble huff old o jay record harold melvin blue note billy paul essentially musician salsoul
fantastic age also begin era dj suddenly start get creative guess good example particular first ever commercially release record believe edit block couple month cult hero mix call walter gibbon walter spiritual deep guy pretty much invent art mix along course probably much melodic sweet side mix walter complete headcase good way put nice possible way outstanding example salsoul walter gibbon mix ten percent double exposure
music double exposure ten per cent walter gibbon mix
problem salsoul record average length mix
generally ten minute another example almost
end spectrum key people salsoul guy call vincent montana jr vibe player also gift arranger see keep swing back arrangement theme time good example top rate vocalist loleatta holloway vincent montana arrangement pure beauty run away
