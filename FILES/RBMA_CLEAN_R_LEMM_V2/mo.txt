limit away without lose sound quality hear around eleven minute old star war album eight year old minute long side

minute lp format tight volume pretty low advise use dmm direct metal master cut lacquer good lacquer groove cut deep material stylus cut machine go deep use wide space make sound voluminous space go shortdistance loop use direct metal master sound will transfer oneone without lose anything have talk normally people come us talk anyone

now go master house go plant master cut master lacquer go plant

pay master press test pressings say euro now much cost come

bad price depend example vision print label look provide specification hope someone side graphic know sometimes take time two color label letsay color black white send us graphic file send developer send press plant france print shop inside factory

plant offer service sleeve

sleeve always do printer depend sleeve say okay case use printer good option

press much pay normal sleeve say great picture baby put cover

copy plan money have advise use sleeve use standard sleeve standard disco sleeve inner sleeve gesture record sleeve manual package come machine sleeve manual package people stand high table hand glove

process get draw

manual package pay five cent four cent paper bag already nine cent extra cost disco sleeve have check course use standard sleeve cyk four color need four film will send printer need less sleeve vinyl will damage transport press plant manual package happen copy expensive sleeve

make new label shy away fancy expensive need keep cost

someone start tell course unless money count calculate tight people love care fancy sleeve even copy stop

someone make track think next big press sit listen say go repress

discuss distributor

label day press batch repress

yes

turn around time master finish product

extra cost press plant take care

take care make sure whoeverresponsible will cover cost may lose time help

another reason make sense come say make good bootleg ever old prince track sampleled press cheeky white label come

also take care mechanical right first question ask performer invoice make sure mechanical right clear

mechanical right exactly
