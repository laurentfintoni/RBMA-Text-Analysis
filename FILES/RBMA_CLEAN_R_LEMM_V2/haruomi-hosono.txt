sense nature arrange music line rule western notion perspective technique logical eye viewer draw distance western music also compose rule echo process many different method work popular music keep study bring us depth dimension music understand importance method course important record mix doesn much band

wonder talk bite work miharu koshi

inform see recently pursue sing style call croon crooner style popularize us record technique release new album madame crooner jazz collection cover mainly standard french style approach fantastic please listen

jump project seem standard almost elemental music country hold interest think

think generation problem believe generation unique fate american culture mention intense long postwar us first time dance boogiewoogie little kid sp record bounce around music gene krupa benny goodman sort music think boogiewoogie work music young people listen strong desire boogiewoogie interest now

introduction touch humor music big believer presence humor wit music humor think quite universal language way diarrhea story will make eveybody laugh obviously subtlety country america england example wonder relate international artist embrace humor whether struggle find easy

already massive earthquake hit tohoku include fukushima many people pretty much stop listen music day also couldnlisten amuse story stop watch comedy fast forward three year many people feel actual emotion fade away know earthquake will hit place earthquake hit us anytime say future life now limit relive past 20 century music mean world will forget become extinct experience boogiewoogie stay free order express way show beat groove use computer technology continue perform live

long little nervous culture general come japan pretty overwhelm sure end say wish bear america often feel people culture sort exchange want japan america want america japan wonder talk japanese culture many great feel often ignore young generation japan amaze traditional culture

difficult japan change drastically since world war ii long people inherit tradition professional singer sing folk song ballad still genre standard japanese pop enka
boom cool suffer talent shortage think around world despite situation young people decide pass tradition future everyone manage everything without system expect accomplish individually instinct person talent try everything try work traditional music techno free chaotic state japan wait see new next creation japan
