think fair statement stage music industry say label people pick phone basis music sound oppose much think may shift far

probably think definitely operate completely different way much large label way music end come ubiquity happen somewhat organically mean must make super group mentality although collaboration artist think may work together generally operate somehow music filter whether hear someone send demo go see band way happen maybe minority independent

mean think anybody look label doubt way start obviously mind people want put good music clear lifespan year must come point balance reality commercial world strike balance need make money survive stay completely true ethic musically

two maybe bite first independent label put record little probably halfway process get realize every record will hit almost point work hard cry end day local radio station play new greyboy single happen somewhat honest assessment record obviously pay attention sign even though say put music point absolutely chance anybody else like record think realize halfway along okay label put record sell thousand copy alongside record sell okay little niche record reissue luvn haight obscure last year put japanese jazz record two track maybe handful people around world know

right little nitty gritty sort promo get do

basically use month promo guy work mad get promos press release together production guy work kick promo also work finish product photographer liner note credit information line assemble obviously four month go absolutely necessary finish product show time promo copy show take care business time

okay let ask purely financial level worth

every 10 record yes every record probably

hand yes hand record come major label look soundscans go cough embarrassment must spend bucketloads

necessarily talk efficiency mean number talk result think good number

letsay single single sell somewhere region copy good single may sell somewhere five ten thousand copy single sell thousand

okay name little bite fan base alright reckon calculate estimate sell five thousand ten thousand record new much money sign

wouldnsign base single

much pay put okay let different track album sell five ten thousand record

five ten thousand probably many mean luvn haight record luvn haight record may expect somewhere range five ten thousand record back five ten thousand record sell cause risk

take john arnold record many sell

luvn haight record always sell little ubiquity record disappoint sell five thousand expect sell rewind compilation usually around plus single combine project may end sell thousand rewind

try demystify artist point view hear people modern independent music world say make money business card djing mean record take ten month blood sweat tear love much money make expect good

extremely hard say hand god far anyone license extremely hard make money say day call card album single moment artist album worth even sell five ten thousand copy part reason maybe sell five ten thousand copy fork four grand remix somebody big expense back sell three buck

audeince member


interest record happen somehow harrymemory bite fuzzy guy record year ago lend copy company japan listen never hear anything back either house burn house master tape store lose master tape probably roy ayers travel hear record come japan couldnunderstand guy new york new business time understand happen track guy japan speak japanese instance couldn anything numb people year tell hey recordcome japan think point may see know back date wrong important record record martin luther king day tribute martin luther king put random day back bite insult another good reason put record anyway track harry whitaker wasn hard track people find ask alright put record say people still interest know send copy cool happy track find clean copy master put guyrecord tell full story happen come good
cunningham put record guy call cunningham everyone call right weird story attach record work groove merchant midback era fax machine fax come fax machine say auction mint copy record everyone know cunningham record bid start thousand pound bid x keep everything anonymous need hell record thousand pound people crazy anyway sell rumor float around mike own ubiquity jody actually buy fly england pay guy thousand pound mike guy mad fine someone want believe strangely friend actually buy super cool send us tape time music say borrow record find guy go ahead put make sure thank end find cunningham still sing wife live las vega tour duke ellington orchestra someone delight hear people still interest record point originally sell playboy club band play st louis st louis playboy club tiki room actually percussionist johnny mathis back day travel johnny mathis around world early actually late buy crazy exotic tropical instrument go studio day record crazy jazz record feature interest percussion make great listen now able track put think let go ubiquityrecordscom check sound snippet let check little file search ipod

cause wonder track taboo jazz dance tune back day reputation reason

gilles petersons rainer trübys people amongst lucky copy definitely champion help make

black renaissance jazzanova pay bassline sample smirk

actually bassline funny ask record actually use bassline put yes give call

interest money harry whitakermoney

probably split us depend agreement part guy first absolutely amaze anybody interest music secondly use dough always case obviously buy record outright someone still pay royalty money able right someone sample someone else want license come us harry whoever involve will still pay

final question generic favorite put label

crap give ten think favorite one remix ptaah opaque remix



keep test little mp player big record time wasn

big microscopic way big small part world definitely anthem

record particular blur boundary unite interest people instance johnny blas percussionist la remix result minute piece detroit techno meet traditional latin jazz crazy record end sell copy get license hear around world people like good one sell couple favorite break boundary way interest collaboration folk

quite sure putting sara creative partner album sound color

sound color tell sorry

want feel release album kanye westgood music label probably good question

general point view artist sign ubiquity go much big cool happen nice organic way comment sara unfortunately someone want come along snap artist fulfill obligation us cool mean way mean werenwrong someone else think music bring even big audience impossible bring cool

okay another question quite sure legal affair distribute release record tru thought unite state

tru thought couple interest record know much good illustrate point frustrate distribution tru thought fairly know label england europe independent sell decentsized record ask many record sell lucky sell five copy state think kill probably also open another avenue first quantic record actually 2 quantic record time put simultaneously way record come england state time first quantic record sell sell seven eight thousand copy state itunes pepsi commercial countless tv show nice winwin situation three record now put bamboo album february another winwin situation realistic pay little bite upfront make sell import make money line license sale everyone come top

good job less switzerland usually easy us ubiquity version tru thought one

bizarre strange good let tru thought thank swiss distributor

reissue always access original master tape

beautiful two reason first usually good sound secondly multitracks mix tape remix do open opportunity album unfortunately majority time case record late early guy move house divorce house burn lose leave puddle water break leave studio million reason master tape anymore unfortunately case will work vinyl go fantasy record use pretty hiend needle record recreate master put process call declicking take pop click may lp oftentimes try search two three copy lp cut good bit glue everything together hopefully will reasonably goodsounding record reissue come little sticker say hey sound new madonna album dirt

ever reissue gram vinyl

record past never find demand every single vinyl get expensive mean insanely expensive reissue may sell half sell total vinyl cd much money maybe point good luvn haight super hiend vinyl

react think breakestra pretty stone throw mean contract stone throw anymore

apparently think past two year decide work artist previous history start label frustrate phrase will still year late sale history sale history carry record start frustrate game play people record store even carry music mean frustrate part little game play tell carry sale history store still carry store wait minute suppose anyway back answer question way sign act slightly big appeal possibly play crazy previous record label stone throw whatever breakestra want little bite different breakestra great live band west coast want represent seem match make heaven

true bad time release record summer

ubiquity label find anything different distribution manufacture product distributor every single territory france spain switzerland germany whatever different distributor say everybody seem go sleep europe less music business june st august th nice long vacation refuse work carry music unless start sell wonorder come september first

month recommend

actually end january till may good time put record festival summer good record catch february march april may see get book late summer tour token good record fall big festival get book end get work follow summer good sale period end january everybody else still recover christmas new year try act together get act together back october november january record ready may label record marketplace january little little competition little little difficult space shelf little bite easy record review magazine january great sort far enough advance help

quick question belgium story finish vinyl anything true

think record industry seem go crazy phase must terrify first time record label back early cassette introduce must excuse french shit pant imagine first time someone say way putting call cassette record album mean pass many copy buy record anymore actually sell record cassette people must think end lp happen right cd come along record cd cd havendied lp havendied still press plant state still press vinyl press plant england anymore turn benji

think maybe interest question raise idea keep vinyl alive people love vinyl dj culture

think answer question mix vinyl limit dj market

mean dj go see favorite dj saturday night play computer cdjs earth go buy record

go honest reissue side half sell vinyl people lp head see club two ipod plug ipod mixer use sure will people personally always prefer play record cd even dj perspective may different maybe will trickle possibility collectorstandpoint reissue type never see record sale take dip strong year ago

subject recycle question sample talk bite major label pay attention catalog right work company pay attention material use illegally

two oftentimes label oftentimes publish company keep eye us spend time wonder sample us general extremely clever ear say early hear snare hit lot people ear recognize sample name 2 website dedicate pay attention blatant sample someone sample track sort depend friendly way business someone numb trilliondollar sell hit use blatant sample track probably even important artist see chunk strange hand people think independent label little bite relax someone start label use us maybe artist use probably call guy say dude sue certain way legally think independent label may code ethic stone throw call us say want sample luvn haight charge major label fee come stupid friendly little agreement end get annoy artist call major label telephone numb literally do call listen record message minute clear sample download form send insane ridiculous whether sell thousand unit even give permission point music mean share right whether mean try license track somebody put compilation maybe degree sample go business right way people pay fair amount insanely outrageous amount everyone come winner answer question
