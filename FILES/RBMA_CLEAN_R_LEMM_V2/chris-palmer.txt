hello chris

four first foremost master engineer mean basically spend day night studio healthy studio tan secondly producer thirdly dj fourthly edit magazine music maker magazine pass around guy look basically work industry year

okay

old start live sound work rig band come crowd house depeche mode omd

front house mix

help rig learn basically work

obligatory cheap black tshirt black trouser

work hour nonstop beach day decide loud sound wasn anymore studio work start edit luckily miss tape edit stage thank god ever edit tape complete joke ever trust gotta make work copy do start edit make mistake go next copy cut quite mission afterwards run whole another tape add noise good noise smile ironically

first start system use

first start edit small mac first sound tool baby brother protools protools come basic bite two channel edit program much else besides rudimentary eq couple crappy compressor process do analog domain still good way eqwise

think

yes absolutely eqwise mean term process much good digitally eqing analog still definitely good bring example track unmastered track master give good idea difference session practical actually take track guy do master give good idea exactly go finalizer unit design master whole master chain inside go show exactly everything software people think bring along show guy easy way demo master many guy actually put record look around participant process guy master process basically entail two firstly eq balance track throughout frequency spectrum audible inaudible balance sound first part relative every time change whole mix change continuous refine right sound 2 dynamic part may loud good people see world always true usually sound loud good dynamic part perceive dynamic actual dynamic range go finalizer nice way demonstrate demo basically try master engineer hot possible balance possible onto format record onto analog format without perceivably change mix mean guy spend three week mix track wanna go change sound two three hour master gotta try without change sound perceivably trick ear believe sound exactly basically idea let play guy track give sort reference come play unmastered version first master version give background
music unmastered house track
bass quite floppy bottom end frequency aren mix much good gonna give master version now see think
music master version track
clarity become good become loud tight hear

let ask question premastered version person mix obviously think mix right



doesn create feel insecurity master mix track think good ability

three engineer whole world eqed go masterings everyone get eqed master engineer eq everything trust particpants marianne david touch yesterday guy studio keep dynamic fairly open mix quite true dynamic actual mix master hard push compress hard job remember guy lie mix lie compress lie dynamic even lie different format dat cd go sound good use okay gonna play example
music unmastered house track
basically mix change much hear mix still fairly similar mean actually change perceivably still fairly similar hear little hear difference good actually long loud kick
participant
track multiband eq combination

yes use mixture multiband limiter

mean

guy work channel splitter live split bass mid high separate signal fee different amp play sound basically do originally master split low mid high compress separately set different attack high quick set low attack bottom slow basically create much tight mix loud mix also will allow eq three separately finalizer three band compressor limiter already split automatically adjust show guy practical bite late

say master music genrespecific example wouldnimagine master rock record way master reggae record

also audience look different rb record guy look hell bass response much wide bass range use rb use house rock rock quite thin actually master yes definitely genrespecific term dance music even specific certain breakbeat style bass heavy

example drum bass

drum bass even breakbeat whereas house producer try pull back little bottom end punch genrespecific absolutely

bad master experience

many mention country official language master do past send unmarked tape nothing basically tracklisting record company put two together try work song try pick lyric work try find someone actually speak language come help also actual mix past horrific mean hz hum come whole mix noise shhhshshshshsh whistle loud

character think

mean noise characteristic noise dr moog agree characteristic electronic noise great mean add flavor song general tape hiss cool bad wire contribute guy difference balance signal unbalance signal cable shield cover wire signal go hot signal two core cable shield use signal negative grind run shield noise sort light cable electrical noise get pick cable transfer sound basically pick noise everywhere now happen balance cable three core shield two cable grind take away noise protect signal anytime opportunity use balance signal rather use balance unbalance much clean much hot play much loud balance signal bite trivium information

music

couple play
music unmastered track master version

blank cd difference brand unbranded process essentially

necessarily mean unbranded cd pretty good mean use specific brand cd cd press plant get press little trouble brand brand use specific brand think gonna make difference much mean certain sort taiwanese various sort cheap copy bad shouldnuse master stage now cdrs useable actual laser write burn onto cd gonna error get transfer somewhere along line

get bite back personal production make music home also make demo home also produce record master home studio necessarily think actually produce record mix record

good advice engineer call jay mix princeblack album come mix miriam makebaalbum studio use work high profile studio lion king ii soundtrack lion king iii soundtrack disney high profile studio johannesburg probably high profile studio johannesburg call csr basically input euphonix mix console two studio high end mix capability run protools high density khz sample system

back guy mix black album

advice give probably good hear put mixdown soft volume level hear quite soft soft hear hear everything balance listen way hear everything cleanly balance mix right basically master dynamic range master engineer hell work fairly open dynamic

producer allow space mean mix may use finalizer may use multiband compressor group insert

rather marianne davis say last night rather individual kick drum bass say yes go ahead final mix also good idea master generally say guy friend sort master give track master master track lose objectivity work track long assistant work mix track write will often master objective ear term listen five million time anymore bite good advice

idea different pass mix

still school especially state different mix every different format tv video cd even advert different way mix vocal track always lie vocal mix instrumental ever go back remix

capella

many different mix take master engineer will choose good

will charge

mean find reasonable master guy expensive sure say friend give track go go much good way think

see day job become irrelevant

think will always need human element transfer format basically sort facilitate transfer format another always think need
