letgive warm welcome mr couple month ago find quite recommendable
book hold vintage synthesizer somewhere stupid bookstore funnily enough
little article someone call go minimoog ultimate antique analog chance read
first sentence

havenseen long time say nearly
quarter century ago minimoog first hit street
begin last decade moog music ceremoniously slap brass
plaque last mini assembly line send
fetch inflate price write

wonder

yet instrumentdistinctive sound much
us today particularly fat threeoscillator bass sound
transcend novelty fashion become timbral staple join small
numb instrument hammond b organ rhodes electric piano
two come mind keyboard hall fame remember write little right

people may two great life make
synthesizer dream little kid fascination weird word oscillator modulation freaky start

kid electronic especially electronic make
sound say electronic electronic today electronic two vacuum tube couple resistor couple capacitor big fat transformer put whole together kitchen table hobby kid play
baseball nearly everybody else beat couldn either like electronic father first amateur radio operator remember day vacuum tube power battery seem avantgarde modern way today seem natural grow computer
electronic grow seem natural
ever since

go play around transistor kitchen table build theremin

back world trade center even world
trade center section downtown manhattan mart
electronic part tokyo today call akihabara
little stall buy resistor tube microprocessor


food market five green transistor

hobby go bronx high school science new
york city good school still learn
science even good wonbeat nerd go go engineer school love

sound music come back

learn basic school whole business sound design sort middle become important part music right
people help

people

think begin almost year ago meet experimental
composer now back experimental composer mean
reelreel tape recorder razor blade splice tape
begin anything else record little segment sound either
microphone electronic extra sure
tape recorder first person work herb
deutsch music teacher hofstra university long island
vision make music tape recorder experimental
audience maybe hundred people
new york city know electronic music meet herb
music teacher conference turn use theremin
build class eartraining sightsinging
ask know anything electronic music think
electronic hobby music take music
lesson say yes electronic music electronic music idea learn quickly herb
couple time ask help make new sound ask mind make mouth sound beeboobeeboo wheeoowheeoo begin think know transistor new know technical property ask idea come make call voltage control oscillator vco voltage control amplifier vca think way many think
putting tune mix together sort idea come

hell vco

use moog voyager play barely audible low tone look see speaker vibrate response electrical voltage oscillator go keyboard oscillator go fast fast play high note octave high note piano oscillator now voltage control oscillator back engineer technician want
oscillator test equipment catalog see picture
big box knob front set knob frequency
want want change frequency turn knob
different frequency good want frequency exact
frequency good musician music change
sound include change frequency hard play big knob
accurately
instead knob oscillator s
place plug control sound manipulate
hand glide keyboard pitch glide way do
keyboard change electrical voltage low high back high
low turn knob call glide rate slow step
normally play keyboard sort
musician instrument designer learn job s
nobody understand vcos wasnpossible


close relationship musician people
experiment engineer come new concept

back us know enough music able talk
musician us actually musician person
work right around time begin still
fantastic design musician engineer
buchla musical vision help
musician

talk say us sound pretty exclusive
club

pretty small begin couple engineer come around
eventually join company people jim scott bill hemsath
name extremely wellknown happen
mooglore will hear name italian television
engineer name paolo ketoff design instrument call synket
early work musician think
similar engineer like work musician

ironically enough call militaryindustrial complex wasn
bad development musical instrument

2 world war whole field electronic advance
incredibly interestingly enough tape recorder invent germany
use 2 world war think manufacturer call
magnetophon couple american soldier bring back magnetophons
happen engineer work company california call ampex
manufacture motor bring back strange contraption motor figure ampex find use motor
new invention tape recorder basically tape recorder
start usa

favourite album go moog sound proud
contribute

gosh many back interest suggest switch bach wendy carlos switch
bach carlos record come seminal think
right word show do nobody understand
start conventional wisdom music business late
make synthesizer make funny sound earcatching
effect put radio commercial experimental music couldnmake
real music course real music

ask

anybody real music people
music business know real music real music music make real
money carlos record make real money people understand use produce play realise whatever word use music wasnimportant
novel first time people want
listen satisfy need music valuable people
switch bach still sell today large sell
classical record time long period thousand
musician around world understand seem
make music

quickly word spread

emerson lake palmer begin tour word spread pretty fast
still point view perspective small
company manufacture cheap
inside nothing cheap back everything analog
take grant want goodsounding keyboard
spend thousand dollar money back
first time show trade show music merchant convention chicago
remember show music retailer come
have look long face have say have say synthesizer have show knob knob usually say expect sell store
expect musician understand walk away

look arp model have voyager strike
instantly texture material use
wood design suppose sound scifi futuristic
retro earthy look

never idea suppose sound never anybody s
goal sound already existence every
musician work different musical vision work different
area music musically keep general
possible synth design make specific sort sound
nice wood case big fat wheel light blue
feel good musician average person need feel
good even use little g computer see
place feel good g feel good pc s
important musician sense try front
panel keyboard happen turn knob feel
good musician
begin almost place voyager market
year now everything original model have quite
bite important feature entire front panel
store memory recall instantly moogwife make comment audience ileana keep focus call
sound change knob knob
gonna anything part sound
knob will begin pick mind work keith emerson mind learn turn knob hand analytic mind
envision underlie structure read manual understand
sound begin oscillator three oscillator
section panel oscillator say oscillator top two three play different effect select pitch range waveform

waveform start

oscilloscope show shape vibration time
waveform

come explanation short teach
school never understand anyway pretty brief

doesnhelp musician unless worry
circuit work shouldnworry exactly name waveform mean isnimportant waveform spectrum harmonic associate hear quality change waveform
hear quality change demonstrate little drawing waveform call triangular call sawtooth look
tooth see another call square wave another call
rectangular wave go continuously
way couldn original minimoog demonstrate
oscillator two oscillator set interval
musician interval three oscillator demonstrate exactly interval set major triad tune three note chord include unison make play three oscillator
note two three hear difference oscilloscope look waveform
see constantly change three wave beat
slowly technical waveformoriented
description musician mean fat sound demonstrate fat
thin
okay talk eight knob three waveform three octave
clicker two frequency knob letcall interval instead s
basic oscillator way interconnect
time let go take care
section another section call mixer three
oscillator mix play note continuously mix strong three change play
addition another source sound pitch sound call
noise combination filter create effect
without oscillator 5 call external jack
back plug sound source guitar turntable
output mixer theremin anything shape
rest

hang plug whatever signal still fuck around




sure take home

sure take home make offer refuse

joke speak michael beforehand

okay section right call filter
electronic operation associate analog synthesizer general
moog synthesizer particular filter happen
turn knob filter demonstrate cut high harmonic
first low one finally leave
fundamental pitch now sine wave filter oscillator voltagecontrolled
demonstrate use slow vibration open close filter instead
hand

lfo us hear project name warp record duo lfo
know speakerrattling

lfo lfo lfo lfo low frequency oscillator

rave level see

okay letplay nice fat sound turn lfo knob
able change harmonic way sort heighten fatness
sound particularly give expressive give sound motion right rate right amount enhance music filter
another control happen call resonance case filter emphasise particular pitch filter filter give filter sense pitch demonstrate without
resonance resonance actually two filter
now hear two resonance
listen closely will hear
come speaker other output stereo
knob change shape filter
move sound around playercontrolled set
exact numb leave alone play put key
put hand hear effect keith
emerson even even use listen pick
individual knob

guess fancy middle help store


touch surface way move sound around
different knob control device use sound
storage recall part part route different


deviladvocate new g powerbook little
three month away us still need machine five
time big probably eight time heavy

answer question g exactly
need other perhaps will find easy connect
musically satisfy produce music whole conceive knob space everything
fact switch nice big fat rocker switch s
design play live

interestingly enough yesterday come back lecture give away valuable
information think strike talk
enslave technology cut whole
live everyday life

right musical instrument always begin
human history use advance technology time musician
need advance technology appropriate whether need particular
advance technology partially depend music make
stringed instrument develop around three four hundred year
ago precision woodworking high technology brass instrument
develop high quality brass ability
machine create thin accurate material brass piano
come existence along manufacture technology us
piano likely hitech mechanical manufacture product
will ever home brass instrument
wood instrument mechanical instrument develop th
century technology time electronic us s
analog electronic now increasingly computer electronic
instrument th century doesnuse
advance technology use come existence
lifetime instance

separate whole analog myth debate

tool particularly comfortable us whether musician
engineer whatever combination soundproducing capability
control find easy connect instrument
doubt g g
different function sound quality though sound make difference
analog part difference explain
technical term fact waveform update time
2 still update step whereas
nothing step analog waveform everything
make sound shape sound analog completely smooth

right legoland see
legoland version house animal matter small brick
still little brick

idea search way say
sound strange connect instrument whether
guitar violin set drum electronic instrument
interaction outside actually finger
connection hesitate use word spiritual
force live exert respond
sure synthesizer even though re
live biological sense sense consciousness
connect people sure
break every tool touch people work sit
computer ten minute late work fact firsthand
opposite make work
look work develop sort connection
instrument will develop sort connection g
g other may find possible instrument
korg triton great

circuitry shaman sort

feel good satisfy part
beyond finger connect even designer even though use make music
sit audience
musical instrument designer sort happen day
intrigue term new device new trend design new
electronic instrument

point now less realm sound
possible interest new control device manipulate even
novation controller connect midi less interest software inside computer make sound make
studio great end
put cd now walk around listen fairly new human history say hundred year ago even little music
together community activity music live performance benefit group people interact have see aspect music flourish future knock record music listen music increasingly lonely activity miss important
human ability together community real
