speak korean

think use big problem stick idea never rigid say spend whole day make beat change drummer try guess go situation studio artist maybe five minute play bunch beat beat okay shit assed
now think try go back idea make guess balance time balance time live life creative also know experience keep ear always open help create music make sense try create standpoint music keep alive try live grow way able find time spend efficient create make music artist know certain amount time able inspire artist session okay job keep ship roll sometimes session artist focus
may woman studio people drink get high hang hey beat pay attention time able okay waste time play music person attention leave worth time create time work big artist may inspire new person want work hard make dope music create

situation need balance producer idea collaborate producer

okay situation three producer big artist

different taste style

different taste style producer hey look dopest beat cool lay back try see situation suppose collaborate together say let jam session play play part person play another key example yah record damn new york session look track time gonna make sit room hang listen music listen bunch dope album back literally dope jam session live band play drum break play sample danny play piano bounce idea make swear make three beat two hour
make music wasn somebody try star show yo let bounce idea sing someone kendrick go jump mic start freestyling start build cycle idea idea idea idea keep yah jam session werenplaying beat know think dope dope play part add keep build actually make song

sound ideal situation sometimes idea fight producer idea right

mean studio work someone person around person leave go cause waste time have rather time important time crucial guess never catch moment music moment record record
sometimes business business get bad people greedy people feel big record gonna try take much suck cause energy mess music work somebody sometime situation happen bad may work together anymore collaboration energy person vibe

chemistry

chemistry chemistry chemistry

studio session artist point think do work idea hear artist

usually try overproduce record mean putting whole bunch sound record make much point especially write somebody write song beat will take certain beat person write melody sing melody write lyric song build late
take process idea know everything full song come try think music space people need much space possible see record
sometime make beat tell scare artist away much firework explosion scream shout much take build
learn pharrell pharrel never meet pharrell listen music good five sound song hear crazy texture hear five six unique sound song make easy person sing vibe big advice have say imagine gonna sing record actually sing much enough inspire idea come song cause sometimes gotta stop okay enough gotta let people sing

start bottom overcome obstacle motivation

think fear try live dream whatever point time produce music live create sacrifice life time people focus energy music worth think time realize gotta big passion guide place never think make good motivate keep great conversation people see time put music energy know oh gonna make gonna let anything stop dream believe
keep even wasnmaking money quit job job still work fulltime job bad behavior come work school still work work work nine five make beat home
save money save money save money point okay actually live music financially okay time cool worry money cause depend music pay make good grow actually start build overall believe believe dream also fear big hurdle cause scare risk limit stop shoot fear able sacrifice time make make
2 question answer
