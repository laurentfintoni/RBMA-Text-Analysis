decision banddecision

banddecision band want record way john especially adamant want make record way time process think think maybe easy hadn have try background vocal hold another track hold john oh think bounce together now track oh hold john let make another slave fly
take grant work digitally difficult tape also tape nostalgia tape especially people nostalgic never actually use amaze workflow sound great also sound terrible absolutely wrong sound amaze record hear back oh right tape anyway production much full analog idea begin

analog seem remarkably agnostic

care come go deep concept land 2 say couple time last week feel start repeat havenheard yet people say matter come speaker think people tend necessarily believe buy true
make record letsay lucky enough actually get release normal people buy lucky people buy idea record edit maybe difference analog happen own turntable now maybe 10 percent actually understand say hey check kick drum care
make amaze sound record anything great make amaze feel record doesnmatter use plenty record early stone couldnbeat demo keithcassette recorder put sound terrible doesnmatter feel amaze
stress enough plenty talk term recordmaking process rest sheila say happy fun onstage point make record feel amaze people hear care use fruityloops analog tape doesnmatter call fruityloops anymore regardless use kick drum pretty awesome

talk

start band actually interest have get call have already
work rick rubin hadnworked chili pepper yet shame see play live good show ever call somebody vocal anthony also overdubs john move anthony mix john need someone engineer
say come saturday see start monday plan dinner saturday okay fine go couple hour never go couple hour show guy record johnoverdubs say right man hard drive use microphone go john will twenty minute
havenheard single song record set hotel room john walk hotel room think have meet maybe maybe walk live room bedroom vocal mic say right letgo song introduction chili pepper land john particular way record record stadium
spend think six week overdubs john amaze record guitar solo stick mic amp have never see idea loud record terrible square wave solo amaze john sound great little bright completely distort matter part tone point

seem band straight band

amaze amaze good musician ever work flea play anything still doesnthink good two hour hanon piano study every day still feel want good piano go back college learn music theory feel get leave behind sometimes conversation meanwhile badass bass player ever bear chad obviously anthony good frontmen ever john now josh incredible

suppose completely honest feel okay think good constantly try learn try good hear people do oh god ridiculous find study even necessarily sound specific use
electronic music neophyte basically old musique concr√©te first hear skrillex sure wasn first crazy drop mix unbelievably loud whatever breathtaking heart stop 2 track slam back okay make happen make bass sound exactly eq use hear inspiration emotionally manipulative mixer make song explode always think ever achieve good suck good right bad

fair want ask couple technical open question general sense notice couple talk past mix box day

now

make decision

start analog mackie console actually mix song work move mackie console move box make sense come completely large console stadium arcadium part directive analog mix neve
point forward mix console reality mix console disaster term modern workflow song console console literally thousand knob little detented position inch half tall unless stand directly idea point take picture hope okay parallax have wrong
recall write knob take hour half fast piece paper take console week late put back console knob exactly use anymore plus fact eq break swap gain structure different power different hot day everything sound different go console outboard gear
explain people mix song time sign song do go okay great call week late say work last week letturn high hat background vocal next feel bass isnbig enough nobody get anymore way record make
enough experience work box okay also sound great now program use plugins amaze fill gap term plugins sound particular piece gear stick decide start make transition make life easy
halfway secondguessing go lucky enough lunch tchad blake guy tchad blake good mixer ever amaze producer cool adventurist mixer ever hear think good record record call latin playboy make two record first selftitled make track cassette kitchen cool sound record ever make
go see pick brain little bite even start talk realize hold 2 box five year now excuse able make work make think almost two year now

compression

love

parallel compression

almost exclusively

explain may

okay everybody know compressor okay good go back far parallel compression set compressor way set reverb instead putting directly now compress version put send
letsay kick drum still uncompressed record kick drum send compressor may crush may whatever blend uncompressed signal compress signal call parallel two parallel audio pad
around forever back day box great box many parallel change long software take care delay compensation technical doesn delay compensation wonwork sound phasey weird doesn probably software point way use may slightly different people will compressor kick drum compressor snare drum maybe stereo drum kit maybe bass maybe vocal
thirty one couple set vocal kick snare drum stereo every single mix except drum bass copy mix minus drum bass go stereo compressor blend
parallel compression versus insert compression put compressor catch peak turn change shape peak leave quiet alone blend compressor side bring low change way sound actually leave peak alone peak uncompressed signal loud anything blend
uncompressed snare hit attack kick drum uncompressed vocal carry emotion will still blend much compress part help loud help consistent sound bite record balance uncompressed raw excite version
share compressor make life easy song mix stereo compressor everything except drum bass vocal loud turn guitar soon singer stop sing guitar come ride anymore do isndone compressor hear alone blend subtle make everything interact sound much urgent energy room watch people play
also people play together downbeat six people hit downbeat never hit unless edit make hit time sound first guy turn everybody little bite messy flam still ridiculous groove always line long answer compression

reverb





reverb reverb right

seem use much though

use much part work rick rubin twelve year huge fan reverb hear way love reverb sound make sound natural big space help build world mix live obvious effect unless suppose obvious effect song reverb
love super long reverbs snare hit cavern grab attention create within song whole style mix every snare hit swim pool sound unnatural hear mixer create hear able feel room whatever
even problem obviously band still drum guitar support voice feel world room room happen couple turntable drum machine instead drummer bass player much natural
use reverbs lengthen snare make tom explode little bite solo sound crazy reverb doesnsound natural track distort guitar snare reverb become length otherwise snare sound little choke make naturally sound unnaturally make sense mean

move question work quite bite rick rubin learn key essential lesson take away work

little learn part
leave band overdubs learn produce actually rick involve songwriting basic track vocal mix spend nine hour mess around chorus guitar part feel free check do
guy work chili pepper weezer amaze band hand think big always listener say make record people anything make record way always listen
reinforce fact cool come make excuse turn around say havendone drummer wasnfeeling nobody care able go everybodyhouse buy record actually record come sell four copy three mom go tell mom happen people
callous doesnmean anything hear make record think great listen anymore behindscenes amaze excuse isngood matter terrify even good excuse even fault care

couple fault work

sure hundred try block

anyone question want right letgo

hello okay honor us thank time

thank

ask advice mix headphone general consensus us afford acoustic treatment room nice monitor good way go

play phantom first little story
music low roar phantom
want play lot low end top end entire record mix headphone assume travel assume back studio put speaker fix everything good sound ever do
answer first do careful hear sony mdr whatever cheapo headphone bright record drummer actually hear without destroy listen year think important
need ton acoustic treatment though able setup speaker important mixer speaker listen nothing important long room isntiny make work angle across room instead straight rectangle lean mattress corner now bass trap entire room
way think big able hear speaker room dead big good small room people spend entire career people way successful mix get new speaker chase whatever use pair speaker year now doesnmatter tannoys doesnmatter need nice bright hear headphone match speaker way
low end feel headphone headphone arenhyped bottom hard find beat people love way sound never low end super process also mix little focus individual sound realize bass kill vocal mean bass isnright
vocalright bass must right nonexistent decide need interaction mix much important individual sound anything long hear
think natural sound find try learn speaker listen ton work think awesome make sure sound awesome come speaker make mix sound awesome come good
little corollary may come idea everything sound good huge learn last year put practice idea mix couple important almost always vocal kick snare always super important bass two instrument play body song may song case everything sound good may track
absolutely doesnmatter sound never solo way people microphone use also go back solo high hat loop see good high hat loop high pass none matter
core element sound good rest pan find level spend time eqing add effect anything mix way good way way way fast way whether headphone speaker little concentrate every track session say man 3 acoustic guitar sound awesome putting back mix minus pan underneath 2 acoustic guitar doesnmatter fix hideous problem go super important

hello follow question regard listen level mix think remember chris lordalge listen low much low hear hard drive good actual mix

low

sit

people tchad actually sound meter sit board make sure always certain level discipline enough think good use level hit certain way listen loud quietly
loud feel good also kid whatever bad loud bad quiet quiet hear mix whole balance stick way loud hear vocal way check quietly two different way listen
think ever listen normal volume ever mix think good make change probably never listen loud super quiet whole time

okay thank

hello thank advice us produce music start finish probably professional involvement end master stage wonder sound selfreleased soundcloud miss fundamental mix technique encourage bedroom producer obtain professional service mix stage overlook today producer

two side technology now democratization make record anybody make record amaze somebody may never get studio engineer producer now actually make record music never hear otherwise make
think idea engineer craftsman much even technology much physic involve electronic involve record technical job serve creative purpose love say hire mix money otherwise hire definition word reality hard make argument think hear lot talk class nyu last week guy songwriter say song record happy think feel good mean doesnsound great feel great mix feel bad opposite mix take everything good need happen make happen make happen big way enhance song
point much important feel good sound good therefore feel good need another mixer feel good nobody else agree make record idea public therefore certain standard sonically will threshold people will listen vague concept
wouldntrust master either master engineer magic bullet crappy sound feel record seminar week long seminar people experience sound amaze happen time song start sound incredible chorus sound exactly okay maybe need make intro first verse sound incredible chorus explode
maybe artist achieve arrangement good extra instrument come chorus add tambourine doesnwork mixer definitely bring help good point mixer realize think already
track lay roadkill chance mixer able sort chance even small master engineer will sort make loud bright
think craft especially record acoustic instrument experience engineer definitely strive experience producer outside opinion music performance assess vocal difficult many record make without couldnsit tell yes hire engineer producer think collaborate happen experience engineer great realize shortcoming find somebody bring
case point wife hear every single mix send part listen completely consumer doesnwork ugh make crazy always right also idea soon play music somebody else hear differently important part process reset way listen easy check cool program vocal effect 2 chorus awesome listen song
soon somebody else come room doesn immediately assess song way professional collaboration way process less somebody come reset dance around bite

thank

hello hear talk use parallel compression havenheard use much way time work people record vocal home whatever tip parallel compression deal vocal sometimes poorly record record harsh way sit sometimes big clutter production may produce

obviously every track totally different vocal harsh rid harsh frequency period either notch filter sit somewhere ¬Ω k range hurt little creative use either multiband compressor favorite use active equalizer different one mcdsp ae think basically pay somebody hang eq every time certain frequency get control dip
much little invasive way sonically deal dynamic example vocal superbly record jake bugg record mix sing quietly full open sound voice sing loud get nasal close nature voice nothing wrong sudden frequency kill rather automate eq spend three hour find frequency seek destroy vocal super loud frequency stay get turn
deal deficiency sound voice first do think find subtle effect will work slap delay short delay filter spop thicken vocal way little pitch shift go plus nine cent side minus nine short delay now sudden vocalgone way short reverb short plate ambience type reverb sudden get vocal use now world see world instrument still poke now have depth will lend back track

thank

hello man thank

thank

question regard visual mixdown much work happen visual base spectrometer

none



look meter care mix super super loud nature way mix come together parallel compression always end around level level loud master engineer complain think make life easy need transfer
absolutely idea mix back still console bob ludwig master respect whatever genius people invent master way call say hey man mix plus plus even talk send without limiter isn limiter mean isn limiter push console feel good
mix crazy loud ever look anything people though personally think problem especially look spectrum analyzer kid spend time fortunately develop plug wave eq development time √ºbergeek try work do care eq sound
try model band eq neve else look exactly audio precision version spectrum analyzer look exactly sound right put snare drum no sound way good find hadnbothered put low pass k high pass hz transformer
nothing eq circuit input box soon put k sound right doesnmake sense time think unless try find problem buildup frequency try find rid point know frequency happen way interact doesnalways make sense

right thank

ever look stop never even start

mean analog day look meter print tape proper level problem come desk hot uncal tape machine crank input db turn mix sound good okay leave uncaled tape machine fit
look look break level good figure chain bring never bring case always bring level never never look anything else

hello first thank big inspiration mixwise especially year ago stumble upon new artist soundcloud jai paul put song call jasmine hear
song

haven

okay much okay question


sorry

okay mix say unconventionally put much sidechaining hardly hear actually say back day harsh criticism actually make intimate sound now stage every day hear new soundcloud artist copy do extent people say mix way loud mix hear extent think listen someone actually technically school follow intuition feel intuitive person

listen right

right

way never right unhappy change wrong say person planet like mix come term idea music business lot people idea music decide live
much much happy producer make record gogol bordello duke spirit love band love record nearly record care case listen people say always worth investigate someone say unless pick master engineer sometimes master engineer will look meter tell loud whatever find different master engineer point



seriously find somebody like mix start think always worth try figure react decide whether mind change sudden still now people whether destroy love
happen micro sense time oh hear shaker loud okay mess groover isn try find entire way music terrible okay doesngive much go give specific see
think important humble enough listen criticism decide whether anything hopefully silently arrogant enough say art destroy easy become arrogant enough say even listen say difficult take criticism sometimes important crawl back hole try figure criticism actually see way fix maybe learn process way sometimes people dicks ignore

thank much

hello mix reason ssl emulator actually mess fader generally keep zero tweak gain maybe actual instrumentoutput maybe little bite difference maybe move half decibel decibel range terrible protocol

long understand signal flow line trim actually emulate ssl first happen fader last happen little level insert compressor turn line trim fine think sound awesome loud line trim now change sound make little go compressor turn fader right wrong way still sound great realize affect aren important pre post signal flow especially sidechaining share parallel compression change spot wonaffect certain change will affect everything

always find reason less mix gain always little profound effect fader always seem mess totally find fader exaggerate subtlety tweak gain

work work absolutely

cool

go somebodyhouse explain use line trim

hey mixer influential sound music business say sound create expectation talk decide artistic point view decide expect sound feel responsible change whole way listen certain type music

ever think macro sense think every mix encapsulate sometimes spread whole album mix far hear big loud deep have excite version artist get start mix sometimes low roar input modular synth program make decision arrangement time make musical decision way unless hear inspire feel make song good
carry forward think anything particular opportunity anything particular make record make artistrecord lucky name back usually bury inside age mean
feel power anything also feel responsibility wontalk whole metallica record mix everybody say way loud figure win loudness war win care
hear track record somebodyiphone speaker laptop speaker sound excite hell job do point suppose aggressive excite record exactly mechanic clip whatever plenty say irrelevant doesnmatter never give responsibility though think oh face ear music come way much think

criticism around metallica record

death threat literally

pull back

go everybody involve record hear record say awesome make controversy much much bad person involve process understand person internet respond somebody try explain away role throw people bus make specific mostly say yes problem record everybody else involve record make

guess curious specific record guess curious process think criticism adulation outside ever affect

preordain mix control mix time mix finally chorus work realize wow blow bring back now chorus doesnwork wish find way make compromise point chorus still work square wave mix
mix doesncome much song arrangement record performance change completely song song little bite even record song will amazingly easy mix another will ridiculously difficult point say doesncome together
take forward figure mix add template oh work maybe work term big overarch concept mix anyway

many record two song obviously people mix song process term get consistent talk process talk artist ensure everything whole come together

job job mix song think time say oh mix couple time bring late project mix two track feel person mix throw master master guy oh sound different couldnmake work think job okay whatever

master

bad experience couple master guy absolutely love eric boulanger use work master lab network place call bakery l chris bellman bernie grundman amaze send mix criticism screw will absolutely revisit mix address whatever hear wrong time man awesome great okay now somebody hear way hear master become weird nebulous area voodoo magic shouldn sorry couple bad experience come rush back

go ahead

hello us produce mix everything produce make obviously mix mix end do make mess process coproducing go back mix set everything back zero compare record everything input go mix oppose coproducing whole time

produce record especially live record say gogol bordello record particular eight people play live track record live band two song day include overdubs except vocal quick completely performance case track live band playback completely flat single eq single compressor assess awesome isnawesome letrecord differently good take change guitar amp manipulation fool actually get
produce mix time mix low roar song play label headphone much production progress mix happen go mix record take even though involve mix stage say okay now start mix course exactly mix come someone else
mix will usually keep everything already pretend track way way modern production instead track stylize way song everything get track incredibly simply microphone straight computer get mess late however come everybody hear say do time mix balance sonically whatever sonically may stylize specific case make record version already
mix stage will rarely strip everything song start waste time call black box pretend already do real problem rather try fix fact see undo make problem diva back generally oh way song go now make do

gripe deliver way deliver get set mix

have easy say everybody spend lot money go studio record reality bother song terrible arrangement bad performance bad bug mix song happen couple time bass verse cool doesn bass verse song feel terrible bass verse become process actually play bass verse send note producer artist hey happen song bass verse feel much good bass verse need b chorus become whole apologize finish song
reaction oh awesome great probably do yes do drive crazy lazy instead say song do awesome let mix sick work letsend andrew see happen fuck whole level involvement sometimes incredibly great inspire creative fun hire mix say cheap right away
annoy obviously rock record mix drum record live room sound doesnmake angry make sad much record explode speaker instead little ms toilet

live room put drum trick suggest

deaden wall go peopleplaces record drum establish band band always do drum kit setup live room narrow live room instance kit width room cymbal four inch away either wall plaster wall hey pack blanket rug hang oh wow awesome idea
deaden room say speaker always setup straight room set across room way microphone win sit right middle stand wave set kick drum will hard path substitute good sound kit good drummer doesnmatter
start use microphone actually concentrate easy put thirty microphone drum kit say ah sound somewhere sound terrible happen get many track rather four mics railroad sound particular way sound particular way kit drummer important

vocal



term mean record great place

mistake go small room big room big live room big wood floor brick plaster wall want dead unless effect hive far mic distort amp normal vocal sound microphone sound vocal bounce ceil microphone wall microphone window microphone make sound messy distant far away
dry good dead room also big room even room feel dead microphone will feel dead will feel phasey weird slap echo also make sure right mic vocalist theory right mic different voice vary sound source anything will ever record
time need expensive mic time sm every u record every single vocal sm control room iconic rock singer around need good vocal sound excuse get good vocal sound cheap microphone

question

hey two mini question

add normal size question



cool

math mix leftcenterright
exclusively putting gradation

neve console mix leftcenterright physical reason button leave speaker button right speaker put center want pan anywhere actually switch pan circuit resistor ear aside drop level little bite sound good try avoid much now box pan place

okay glad two question somehow go together approach mix box compare mix console go past zero oppose plus drive console pretty hard computer

print mix back computer still limit big voltage console put plus interface align minus bring mix db fit back pro tool anyway actually infinite headroom pro tool now logic believe cubase reason ableton float point mixer
technical instead normal encode record bite bite value correspond voltage maximum voltage describe numb float point start use exponent describe numb db loud voltage manage turn point get converter remember use doesn become square live way
actually way headroom box ever console turn mix last gain stage recapture wave form clip have print loud mess go see without change sound mix much push much start sound bad great tool
technical pro tool stereo bus get whole mix get whatever plugins mix make master fader bus recover peak mess fader anytime mix will sound exactly completely change level mix

right thank
luisa puterman
hey curious mix dvds mix surround configuration

do couple surround personally unless live show see point unless production do record listen two speaker necessarily enough instrument fill space
say early feel strongly especially live musician understand room begin mix make sense song acoustic song start acoustic guitar 2 verse 2 acoustic guitar player come actually begin song hear chair creak side guy even play minute half come already know exist musician room
think easy think much difficult nobody listener sit middle band music think good idea actually think bad idea also many people home theater okay sit screen music suppose five identical speaker room five identical speaker surround setup home sit spot every time listen music doesnmove around
stereo recover walk around room also hear dan mix shaker part rear right speaker first shaker song stereo mix blend underneath high hat make sound awesome now annoy shaker player sit behind groove go completely go
talk much exact education work listen mono stereo version beatles record room stereo version state release england mono release state need different france release maybe mono whatever early record leave right arenpan pot nothing middle
listen doc roberts lady madonna mono version band involve completely different stereo version lady madonna groove hip hop track mono version ridiculous bass kick piano go together practically make feel loop stereo version split sound honkytonk song totally different song never like lady madonna hear mono version take wrap three speaker subwoofer nowhere near middle anyway enough say
luisa puterman
sorry another question say mix orchestra

way
luisa puterman
secret

treat every mix exactly obviously end along way make totally different method work box completely different console term order use try make excite
say mix classical record composer new york sara snide amaze work full orchestra seven solo voice choir sound design ton percussion hundred track make work become obviously specific sara okay need 2 oboe come support line echo compositional important important kick ass exact way problem
start voice come listen music support voice super excite super loud probably loud classical record year percussion badass exact parallel compression put rock drum kit job impact power size depth
think important specific microphone away orchestra good performance try lean oppose try take bunch spot mics make recreate space orchestra specifically think big let try totally different mix else
luisa puterman
thank

question
noash heark
hey question stereo image go super mono track right face widen mention detuning short delay early anything else

short delay short reverbs pitch shift guitar solo work great long go far enough start sound chorusy sudden come speaker key though listen do go back listen balance mix feel wait minute yet take go blink feel shove tiny little hole put back oh right
soon start hear though think start gimmicky sometimes good obviously vocal necessarily sometimes good take center put side nothing wrong guitar solo side feel band
sabbath record mix two guitar live overdub every basic layout record live guitarist pan leave start solo guy play solo doesnmake sense move middle

talk quite bite less philosophy hear band live band hear people play people electronic producer necessarily point strive do work surreal rather realistic

entire low roar record song feel band program track kick hat cymbal stack snare drum tom fill entire record way put together obviously problem think say band people try across try excite sheila play every night either see hear smile good time see shred idea lean forward parallel compression make sound lean forward energy people perform music absolutely loop program loop program sit super excite placement time groove way sound way interact
think band generic term whoever play band apply classical record much problem much chili pepper actual band specific musician certain part sound stage make sense think listener feel hang chili pepper bad fact sound super excite happy play song point make anything

question

real point anybody make record suppose bore go
dxheaven
hey sorry feel need sometimes fill bass part wasn stage mixer draw line embrace crappy drum sound record live room part production move add kick sample even play bass part wasn find balance

mix do deliver suck whatever take threshold much will track directly proportional inversely proportional much pain ass people honest people mix feel respect whatever woneven see do help track much little incline
people appreciative collaboration whatever take say mix sound terrible hope say win gig threshold go go unhappy happy
dxheaven
okay

gig turn maybe work people past hear touch

turn whole reality economics record industry nobody money remember set threshold work little song month late take half money ever part turn gig pain ass absolutely
plenty artist myopic weird crazy vision come creative place will sixty revision mix realize sometimes sometimes finish control
remember project time somebody actually let slip feel sense power make mix revision nothing whether mix need revision feel make make change mix now people work money small super easy turn make much difference life
someone offer million dollar allow total pain ass work couple year take economics think important work music actually find love work tell anybody work
mix barry manilow record mix record somebody sound barry manilow mix actual record barry manilow nothing ever listen interest process fine music good job impossible shouldn artist think

way take relate last answer play song pick maybe talk little bite music room adele
music adele love song
adele love song talk little bite song mix

first fact cure cover awesome bossa nova cure cover even good mix seven song record use four think go strange have do mix shootout different record rick produce apparently win shootout gig sure work
