question two mics come

hey hello mention bring song sound forge affair sound factory put

usually use sound forge record tool tend edit sound sample sound forge program piece software good look find new comfortable sure whether become part mac family use logic sequence tool think bite restrict certain sound whatever think idea end day make music without use lot different unless idea sound forge definitely

producer record label owner legal advice have share us important issue

producer always suggest always great creative person find someone help look certain degree maybe managerial begin someone look whether friend good business lose find first three four year putting money away tax certain different end think oh make load money suddenly suddenly owe people load money important

two question inaudible point become kitschy

kitsch
participant
everything inaudible

pop music much type music think people wonbuy popular culture underground remember reason people sign major label bloody good try check album people maybe people think may completely cheesy amaze producer reason work artist major label fact amaze always surprise album buy maybe buy britney spear album hear track producer hear may completely crazy never

make contact inaudible

contact kate bush try difficult

life cottage

yes real reclusive smoke load dope think inaudible

inaudible

quiet village actually next year actually sign deal album say actually replay everything go along line quote obscure probably almost certainly say away press say four thousand record start worry major label isn take notice press thousand record small run fact whole bootleg culture say kate bush whatever actually great promotion sometimes love love guy will bass mix drum bass mix track great promotion mean pay remixer

inaudible question reveue

partner beatport dj download work maybe old consumer company involve whole important great way especially company already establish great way sell catalog great way invest money new music sell old music great people buy music old fashion love vinyl love smell love jacket come design

far revenue concern make much sell chart much actually make sell record much make resource internet

depend deal partner think itunes think unless say thousand thousand earn absolutely nothing beatport good way gain revenue quite high dealer price good obviously vinyl vinylincredibly expensive manufacture pay bar code need sell music digitally sure will start buy hopefully year anyway hope answer question cool
