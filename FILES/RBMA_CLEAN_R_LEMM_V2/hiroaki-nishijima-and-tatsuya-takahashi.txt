life reenactment lose translation fun lose either way whether japanese german english today talk physic physic behind sound give big hand dear translator booth hide behind wall great honor japan talk wonderful machinery make wonderful sound two accomplish gentleman different generation probably common please join welcome nishijimasan takahashisan work place speak cultural difference folk back home call korg pronounce

korgu

now go home friend brag pronounce properly bite interest story way company come together actually end work

study electronic engineer college also music circle campus band nothing serious choose work korg utilize knowledge music engineer

music circle university

play hard rock progressive rock

favorite progressive rock band

pink floyd king crimson emerson lake palmer

big soundscapes involve

join korg late mr nishijima background electrical engineer much focus sound general engineer course include electrical have always actually even get music build circuit make sound have since kid actually start build sequencer oscillator synth experimental noisemaking finish uni bum around year europe build day dawn proper job think korg korg cool look korg happen japan japanese think great excuse move japan pay

mr nishijima guess different situation get involve information start available guess back mean machine front make time exploratory right

ms release emulate version go market last year original size decide build small version ms mini release last year work machine first assignment first join korg fruit labor original model circuit machine basically design fumio mieda pioneer japanese synthesizer actually still work us korg today arrange circuit mieda design create first model tailor massproduced factory take exact design use part back also modern engineer recreate machine ms mini release last year

still analog

yes completely analog

pretty much circuit reengineer component today add original come come software plugins emulate ms work quite intersting spin year engineer original engineer plugins engineer small size think quite unique experience engineer think anyone else do

especially since

also work legacy collection software else software synthesizer release yes believe initially three us team think sell fun experiment us begin build software time sound become hungry want make good signal process learn university way decide ignore rule strange say decide set rule aside main objective rebuild hardware use software great challenge use analog circuit simulate software korg patent call cmt short component

component model technology

utilize create legacy collection software

someone work field software field hand analog fierce debate sometimes almost religious do actually sound good pro con

software computer call cpu cpu wasnefficient first build software use modern cpu will definitely upgrade sound work even today believe analog outdo analog give good quality work develop software raise speed compute capacity maximum possible mimic analog sound theory unfortunately present computer performance yet nutshell

even consider rapid increase compute possibility still good enough somehow explain laymanterms actual difference analog signal signal

show switch screen mac difference analog synth inside look quite different circuit monotron right probably simple analog synths around basically make capacitor resistor transistor diode fets maybe four five different component use make synth part circuit example vco vco make original raw waveform demonstrate sound raw sound vco hasn modulate circuit component call c basically charge reset charge fast rate hz become tone play music analog synth will actually create signal current voltage whereas synth will create calculation regular interval time

care musician

fundamentally different realm finite numb calculation minimum spin interval calculate will ultimately determine resolution sound rather signal completely define whole cycle waveform will discrete point join line instead see finite resolution work domain

little bite wave instead step stair

staircase often portray way set dot join line allow within bandwidth bad square step see finite numb dot lose resolution think necessarily mean bad waveform human ear good hear khz think make analog synths special although analog purist fact work software rid problem easily dc cutoff problem think analog synths problem find workarounds inadequacy little quirk circuit end give product character go back year look analog synths sound completely different different quirk circuit make sound way

way us human being little quirk ideally make us charm

absolutely

guess question people worry day point will calculation fast enough artificial intelligence actually surpass human

think go path think cool think interest analogy much process power need actually make feel human similar question synthesis much power need make synthesizer quite organic analog think still quite far honest

bizarrely enough machine use robotic quality time triple loop headfuck basically machinery machinery human

interest sure talk korg release product call miku stomp play guitar vocaloid sing guy vocaloid

may nice explain vocaloid everyone

vocaloid technology develop yamaha lab synthesize voice play someone sing synthetic voice sing go lab research interest ever hear vocaloid character hatsune miku sound real now technology make real tell difference real voice synthesize voice good real always paradox machine make real make heart still need machine cool paradox always work think

paradox mention human earcapabilities also hear eight hour club club year little leave hear guess discussion fetish actual scientific discussion

may front us machine machine use people machine artistic ability less yet music make us human use electronic use equipment make good music everyone enjoy people still machine

note enter korg machine already part ms series say bring machine make different other

synthesizer engineer portray design take job think different engineer personally put usershoes think use product use synthesizer band keep mind user enjoy simple electricianwork need fine instrument honest see craftsman engineer hard translate maestro aim

translate say craftsman engineer

guess notion important people admire culture country choose path try good particular path possible try deep repetition research practice go translate daily routine year routine change

truth work analog circuit difficult issue come work electrical circuit since student still learn next study many decade field will technical need electron within transistor electron proton talk study elementary particle level actually fan physic study world elementary particle lead physical property semiconductor bite complicate translate finally begin understand sound make hand analog circuit elementary particle level level long sequence tread word stay place analog microscopic level also scatter instead sequence scatter first place make close analog need align sequence make possible must raise sample frequency megahertz resolution maybe bite day analog still fine human ear maybe people exceptional hear people outside music industry day near meet analog quality
torsten schmidts
mean music business side engineer business guess people intimidate physicality physic first place start read physic realise level almost read philosophy even religion almost recommend read way lose fear front

way lose fear listen noise perfect example physic make sound think way white noise make within analog synth basically semiconductor junction usually conduct direction play voltage raise voltage enough energy level break barrier storm electron burst barrier call avalanche effect think appreciate physic quite good sit listen white noise demonstrate white noise electron

actually imagine little particle

rain

rain absolutely rain collection discrete drop fall random interval exactly parallel electron

say rain use example scientist try organise train station way try organise people flow rush hour look water behave creek hit stone similar analogy shape sound

water analogy always electronic power supply resistance wire thick pipe little resistance current water analogy much start start learn electronic

want go back picture 2 say nittygritty detail behave able example look have go oh design

korg circuit isn part ms

good educate guess actually

um guess way symbol style way line draw mr nishijima first tell good circuit draw beautifully part craftsmanship representation engineer happy point year ago say schematic look good quite happy

guess may deserve extra round

may add schematic see paint work art say paint suppose beautiful order recognize think schematic diagram also beautiful

make circuit beautiful

diagram appreciate someone make electrical circuit straight line use short distance beautiful see signal sound flow useless part simplicity good little part little chance will break make good design also need strong strong product difference professional amateurdesign circumstance machine wonbreak work pro

guess bad point incident early wasnworking

oh ms give possibility may break difficulty ms think someone hack send excuse come fullsize come kit assemble whoever assemble quite interest sound quite good though cause flip signal

sometimes arenright good effect

absolutely circuit show now disclose put public domain think month release monotron purpose people hack although always risk disclaimer think good people get hack normal guitarist change pickup change string basically hack basically make instrument personal glad put people hack gear mean even release schematic people get interest

pretty modern approach intellectual property people deal

sure sure think great career start time internet probably googled ms schematic find schematic easy information probably treasure look safe somewhere decade ago open now think have good us acknowledge officially

nishijimasan find schematic learn people peoplework think oh beautifully do

first see schematic internet old mxr schematic look elegant current mxr old also schematic sequential circuit prophet seem extremely elegant see beautiful schematic feel creator emotion desire make good instrument think excellent instrument will stand test time go history

late dr also believe sort ghost machine subscribe

name doctor oh dr moog great respect dr moog first person introduce electrical instrument synthesizer world admire sorry long us chance meet dr moog namm show take place year ago maybe year meet numb wellknown figure namm show unite state sure wonremember privilege meet oh mr think also excellent engineer

pretty sure less person alive will appreciate say ghost think live inside machine

yes agree dr moogbelief design machine put heart schematic hard explain word see schematic dream think dream go product
become ready hit market piece machinery also instrument difference sound compare guitar make craftsman massproduced guitar think electronic circuit make instrument year believe ghost live inside explain science actually believe exist

mean notion animate common culture time say machine ghost part

animation machine product design feel call name since attach

people name car make sense blackboard edition ms put wall chagall bite spirit studio way

hang picture

say blackboard edition ms guess educational purpose wall chagall artistry spirit whoever work studio

yes think happen

buy buy piece machinery buy part soul

soul priceless korg always gather make affordable ms come nowhere near price range competitor machine design now guess company philosophy degree

mean time reason join korg provide ton accessibility people money drive people make music bedroom gear use korg join company look schematic ms example see philosophy actual circuit filter ms think vcf use few numb component ever never normally

filter use exclusively korg korgcompletely original filter

see see circuit vca similar use transistor alter transconductance quite aggressive way use component time give distinctive sound also affordable manufacture fine balance costconscious find sound identity deliver together still around new product make

time people now say filter new version ms mini compare one sound different discussion emotional quickly guy sit different

think sound different different go back actual physic semiconductor never dope two different piece silicon always difference think embrace analog think beauty

much freedom actually steer woodcutter stonecarver rely engineer do fabricate degree build conductor semiconductor rely industrial piece create new industrial piece

correct make custom chip expensive business synth business unfortunately usually big enough merit dish custom chip complete control everything usually end use component readily available control choice mainly component make small tolerance try use try make work

intimidation factor folk first approach machine see knob see empty socket see cable lie around guess unique opportunity introduction different section also probably help us lose inhibition also guess general mechanism apply tonegenerating device maybe great give us physic lesson

gear analog synth fair maybe half okay letgo half deep half entry

letstart entry level always spice

noise think mention vco early vco section synth will create raw waveform will eventually work modulate create fine sound start point pick see wave look noisy pick call see wave shape see tooth think analog synths start see wave internally process make square wave triangle wave demonstrate see wave triangle square wave see square lance top actually artefact vc card cut low make slope essentially three sound usually come across vco guess hear quite nice buzzy mellow round sound whereas square wave hollow triangle wave almost sine wave low amount harmonic

need harmonic overtone understand

talk filter first basically different harmonic content harmonic content note hz harmonic hz three time four time five time regular interval peak depend waveform start next bite talk vcf filter change harmonic content put lowpass filter change cutoff bring high end spectrum demonstrate see immediately edge disappear turn cutoff round signal take away sharpness interest waveform actually look sharp sound sharp look round sound round warm tone
go back harmonic content sawtooth array harmonic pick use filterresonance resonance actually emphasise certain frequency take resonance demonstrate emphasise certain part certain harmonic bring right fundamental almost hear sine wave harmonic content bring octave high hear high octave add note octave high go slightly high 5 major 3 keep load dissonance high go harmonic content dissonant match musically fundamental turn change start waveform lot harmonic shave one maybe add work synthesizer basically maybe story
go square wave completely different harmonic content demonstrate fundamental hasn 2 harmonic go straight 3 actually cut low square wave harmonic sound completely different change start work filter create array different sound basically need synthesizer

story button

um mainly modulate

modulation laymanterms

modulation change basically tweak knob back forth actually modulate cutoff frequency finger instead finger actually lfo low frequency oscillator manually lfo quite fast demonstrate fast lfo speed lfo also work pitch modulation

much think actually need musician first place

talk think important end day ear much important knowledge harmonic lie figure listen sound time work synths especially analog synths quite distinct strong character sometimes sit mix part play time case switch waveform turn resonance bite work sound experiment find way

hardwired bite patch come

particular synth fact patch synthesis usually synth weird sample hold make spacey sound maybe little bite involve

sample hold guess people grow sampler invent always bite confuse

sample hold basically way continuous signal play hold stop signal regular interval sine wave sample hold will become staircase wave quite cool make spacey sound

try common

common way plug pink noise sample hold clock lfo

clock mean

mean lfo determine point regularly signal hold see maybe plug mr nishijima demonstrate instead putting pitch put cutoff sound computer computer actually never make turn sound cause plug look start pink noise basically noise plug sample hold cutout sample hold look make maybe bite fast basically pink noise screen stop regular interval voltage hold still plug pitch cutoff demonstrate sound good

guess little deep afterwards cause around ideally may around little bite folk deep good chance also want touch briefly little machine available world fly shelf

volcas

reason

come go back monotron release humble reentry analog market analog synth five knob hard play conventional music soundtwiddling noisemaking demonstrate synth noodle fun quite conceptual product throw market see people respond response people like mess synths like analog synths care filter come whatever know ms filter eyeopening positive reaction product spawn next product monotribe similar synthesis sequencer actually make loop also drum machine mr nishijima make synth section make bite music make loop nishijima demonstrate

note guess worth mention korg actually start drum machine company

first product make doncamatic

donca

onomatopoeia way sound tweak machine announce doncamatic founder korgvoice think worldfirst drum machine

wasn mpc anything sort sort drum machine use story behind company come fruition

think mr nishijima inform

korg found mr kato engineer mr osanai pass away mr osanai expert machine engineer also
accordionist play accordion nightclub play need drummer hire cost headache think maybe machine replace drummer mr osanai korgfounder expert machine engineer try invent machine play drum human bad mood work machine control easily want
convenient player

reason guy design machine look little bite accordion turn sideways

first rhythm machine
doncamatic invent mr osanai introduce electronic sound use begin release first synthesizer call korg exist old day original polyphonic model dozen connect korg play connect monophonic synth use accordion origin synthesizer experiment back

many

mean accordionkeys around gesture size instrument synthesizer key control accordion side story machine circuit korg draw man still work korg name mr mieda electronic circuit engineer involve project ms fundamental circuit design ms
release several ps series attach oscillator filter key key guess polyphonic synth exist already ms release take tone
synth make monophonic basis product old skill
use filter circuit korg without change volca structure different ms volcachords filter circuit korg fit actually takahashi take filter experiment say steal
old day check hand
whether semiconductor fit filter need screen match characteristic semiconductor actually diode day measure screen hand anymore diode use sell individual part nowadays tape together take measure screen will impossible solder substrate experiment sound use without screen procedure point takahashi notice sound great happen use filter volca

filter monotribe derive ms fantastic sound monophonic synths work volcas three vcos three vcos need filter will work harmony smoothly wander office filter project mind mr nishijima work call diode ladder filter inherently quite difficult circuit manufacture stable experiment make possible perfect time look filter sound great put production come together volcas

also machine house call monopoly mention monophonic polyphonic quite bite briefly explain people care particular machine fun

monopoly monopoly wasndesigned senior worker four vcos oscillator vco change pitch individually monopoly filter vca make four sound time call monopoly foursoundpoly though make name mix mono poly designer intend make monophonic synthesizer four vcos monopoly use ics use sequential circuitprophet product ssm curtis sound familiar us easily accessible user monopoly recommend point crossmodulation mix oscillator make complicate sound close fm monopoly control flexibly actually completely analog model model model monopolysounds people care

go back monophonic polyphonic think word paraphonic monopoly four vcos play separate note will go filter vca modulate paraphonic rather polyphonic actually demonstrate play three different note go circuit mix

monopoly also available software function use perfectly pc

briefly explain four little machine design open question

okay since talk synths start two synths monophonic synth will play note sound good speaker say diode bridge filter sequencer vco demonstrate two vcos 3 synth bass bascially

much take hint certain bass machine

um

need call lawyer

spell see

guess cross inspiration different manufacturer everyonefollowing everyone else

exactly look three come time important people message few knob big chunky knob look make bass sound polyphonic synth play demonstrate synth quite complicate synth lot knob lot parameter work motion sequencer parameter create loop want look

different kraftwerkdie roboter sound instead stylophone

different

similar interface right

interface similar sound quite different think particular image think have little bite different

way cost factor determine aesthetic guess look conscious decision make affordable possible

yes start plan new product start much cost size speaker many knob close actually make happen start okay use knob flash separate display show also will use case use mold three product cost always important part development actually think quite liberate work cost constraint say analog circuit always problem need find solution way find else quite excite work lowcost product need find workarounds avoid use expensive component discover wouldn money world end become affordable lot people enjoy everyone winner

drum section

isn synth drum machine demonstrate clip kick drum bascially pulse resonator raw kick sound analog drum era basically base sound time

new

new funny actually analog manipulate sample actually destroy sample start play sample maybe change pitch slice make glitchy whatever automate turn automation demonstrate change start point end point sample pitch around gesture volca machine around decade think whole point volcas revisit different format example isn anything new newness everything knob automate completely change game try borrow past put different context different cultural set different type box different price set make completely new

say fit hand luggage lose bag sometimes happen people play night need worry pay rend rest year insurance guess question mic

wonder extent interact musician make design question occur talk humanmachine interaction musicianmachine interaction

depend product usually musician come quite late especially talk idea word actually product feel dangerous point involve different kind people prototype work quite sure good point start round musician ask opinion always difficult balance quite flat various peopleviews whether productgood try involve early possible us prototype ready

think interest say work cost constraint like also wonder money object

constraint liberate money world make new product honest idea mr nishijima

tell whatever
matter much cost go work forever maybe never new product engineer try
whatever want see end product available try hard make product good manufacturer cost constraint work weigh cost make customer unable buy product keep balance difficult develop product spend money make product make good one engineer selfsatisfaction musician quality product never sellable market think need cost constraint

time city probably high density ferrari dealer planet seem market different type cost constraint artisan craftsmanship artisan synth builder

think think have bore load money think fun people interact product isn say good think sale figure think important feel put product worthless deliver connect think probably wouldnbuild synths money world able everything nothing

hello mention briefly circuit bend kid actually modify wonder anecdote discovery make chance try daily basis rare event

think happen happen chance quote
quote talk say circuit sound good happen feel design circuit mean sound certain way image sound work cad draw circuit test prototype lucky work lucky sound way intend time sound different sometimes sound different good way sometimes sound different bad way term accidental discovery time incremental think think ever short circuit mistake discover new way synthesis never big mr nishijima experience accident

make sound need build
substrate call pcv case design wrong unexpected sound come try check discover accident obviously intend design usually engineer never design happen design especially since tend follow stereotype engineer decade experience unexpected example patch patch wrong person doesn electricity astonish sound still discovery today people feel way guess mystery sound still unknown even us engineer world sound quite interest

nishijimasan takahashisan thank join us explore wonder sound put thank much
