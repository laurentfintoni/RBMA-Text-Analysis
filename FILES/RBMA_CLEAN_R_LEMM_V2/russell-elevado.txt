sonically two sonic make album special bass drum anything particular approach record mention come micing particular approach

less half drummer drummer good sound make job much easy approach get good amount whole frequency spectrum drum go hz way far hear drum voice probably wide frequency spectrum try capture whole sound individual drum stay room stand five foot away walk around see whole place mics accordingly sort similar set time depend drummer room move different room mics around overall drum sound end track mix combination separate mics overhead room sound try capture air feel front kit

many mics average use kit

average probably eight two snare two kick single mic tom usually use single overhead many people stereo overhead unless huge piece kit use single microphone top

record equipment talk us electric lady studio significant record

funny have go visit richmond start album talk visualise conceptualise time turn jimi hendrix have hear purple haze fire play hendrix freak holy shit hero influence hendrix never know year huge prince fan prince hendrix whole stage persona hendrix play album do electric lady stevie wonder lead zeppelin album say go record mean still around go see studio walk studio say let album

presumably virgin supportive time

time realise millionhalf dollar late have still work album werenfinished millionhalf

come mix record start point classic putting everything zero feel already start mix record mind

definitely feel track think difficult have keep bring rough mix home take use hear superraw form have say keep rawness eq want
someone find cassette tape obscure band old still play hiss old demo tape someone lose vibe want create subliminally little scatter reason

long mix take

mix two week perfectionist have two week three four day wouldneven listen have leave okay great experiment okay letput bed lose perspective hard part end keep perspective head ready move forward old love ready move hard part last part mix process maintain

talk track untitled feel mention prince hendrix influence definitely hear

funny every song think story untitled already past ten deadline two year late walk say cut new song say cut new song already work walk time nobody pressure record label come put pressure try put pressure hugely budget already miss 10 deadline try cut new song walk studio walk around beer come back say come russ nothing happen play song soon hear okay letrecord last song record single
music untitled feel

record listen complete album interest get take concept album lp seem increasingly lose artform

album general

concept album listen start finish relevant putting music together lp format keep alive definitely feel mix program lp experience rather random song

turn around now producer especially hiphop rb world produce oh new artist timbaland
produce good missy produce song completely wack material buy two good song waste time wonder everyonedownloading spend cash two song albumworth complete garbage

favourite lp time term sound content

definitely jimi hendrix album definitely big influence grow play guitar way record make feel beatles record even day still pick holy shit realize compress drum part stevie wonder album raw quality everything sound room close eye feel drummersitting right vocal horn big pink floyd fan talk record general

think mix sound perspective guess overall experience

definitely dark side moon awesome top bottom
grow new york radio station play perfect album side every thursday people call request perfect album side abbey road another great top bottom take needle record turn

depress put work hear mp

get use help anymore shame substandard become standard people prefer necessity ipods little ipod shuffle now put song cool people care anymore sad guy try keep alive compare analog do entirely comparison hand compare

even play wav aif computer cd hear difference two

converter people realize take care every aspect process show end skip process cheat middle show say use great mic vocalist rush couldntake care particular
use tape day easy use protools careful whole process take time show end project wow glad record sound


listen ipod put aif wav

fact first ipod year take ten year even cd player house much huge analog fan

mix perspective important will sound go will go old day people use listen crappy speaker know sound radio consideration now people will listen crap mp

consider though listen computer especially studio say go europe mix project foreign studio listen many different system try play club car shittiest speaker find pretty much standard able play anywhere every time mix take home play car two three time come next day

dj collector transfer now may start purist think everything aif wav cd quality whatever realize put music collection need nasa level storage take pepsi challenge mp aif average person will never still quite upset hear music compress even level right

use use doesnbother anymore mix do get level hear pay attention

rather hear music play vinyl cd

vinyl good system reason people home need good turntable good system cd away small system still make sound loud bass prefer vinyl listen cd

anywhere near computer print everything tape everything analog people basic setup home neve record desk home access ssl mix console step take ensure record good quality vocal bedroom situation nice quality guitar part

look budget start good microphone good mic preamp buy neve console buy high quality mic preamp look quality major budget save good microphone less medium level buy box wait little bite save money next level far record protools use high quality converter expensive medium quality converter affordable day definitely stay away box good start tweak sound depend perceive sound approach music use limit ear definitely crappy system make everything sound crap stay away test everything buy listen word mouth get around high quality gear

find load studio around world close around

yes pretty much dry unfortunately protools revolution start intern back people still come demo people cut deal manager cut demo price x amount day end work studio manager look sign album now people demo house fine evolution production whole people home record label spend money anymore budget go way everything protools cut album x amount money kill studio business

studio close use reel tape home engineer maintain standard care

fortunately people ask format people work mix album make sure record possible spoil

important master final mix album percentage

depend someone mix suck master person save push frequency miss delete master engineer save time people come protools file stem remix album master now master go two day re level everything separate drum bass vocal make final decision master mix good master ice get level cd level

talk artist work year

talk kid

hey say play guitar musician interest musician help journey epic mix

think definitely help sort musical background obviously help want specifically engineer producer definitely think help relate artist try sound across try explain even help session move little good far know different section come vocalist room horn player may able hear key musician may able hear person definitely help session technical level say musician

cool exact difference engineer producer suggest idea person record producer role

technically guess back day producer director basically point people right direction steer along try emotion direct whole band engineer technical guy look engineer cinematographer producer director traditional role now producer sort songwriter engineerroles guess always remain producer now seem person direct whole song writer less rb pop music

question put vinyl send tape record vinyl tape win format will time analog

wait sorry say

put vinyl send tape record vinyl

good question vinyl call transfer now vinyl master anymore still come master cd transfer onto lathe true true analog master huge process people still day huge calibration everythingcd now get store back time people need machine proper analog master cost money time use master make vinyl copy
