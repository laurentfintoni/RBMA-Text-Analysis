much improvisation band come studio hit record say zone nine minute listen back realise nine minute improv tune right

totally always different hard explain improvisation pretty much track live jam decompression track play first think take five hour write part put together effect make work think mix couple time actually stop
time hit record write process will actually come good part song first time hear bassline right excite first time way play energy try make five time try fix little mistake jam may try mix bunch time track particular probably mix bunch time another bassline come come idea track start synthy synthesizer hear begin sh basically arpeggio around decide hit certain note

people may term arpeggio

may arpeggio basically hold chord keyboard cycle chord either may octave hit threenote chord may octave whatever
way sh work pretty much synthesizer studio work run oldschool way din sync trigger particular bassline note revolve around rhythm note send rimshot tr tell play note midi bite different reason sound change guy synthesis basically envelope synthesizer everything hold decay nice sh decay slider right drop certain note basically hit mimic jam slider dhhhdhdhhdhh hit note note note fly around offbeat put little filler whatever hit note delay make fill anyway basically
synthesizer play bunch chord revolve bar loop round drop trigger long amount trigger send multiple amount note play synthesizer revolve loop five trigger five note always loop around fourbar phrase change end still use five trigger may different place bar
instead play five note go around play five note note instead five maybe change couple basic way work nice put boundary use computer write drum bass love computer possibility endless whatever also nice work oldschool gear accept fact move add another part

give people idea studio look man

studio basically front channel allen heath gl nice mix board right hand side sh beside elektron machinedrum sh tb beside call siel italian synthesizer weird cool shelf purposely touch everything mix able grab everything go able change actually hand whenever jxp except programmer jxp wire sit beside mixer change parameter synthesizer right mixer tr gesture hand indicate position put computer record side gesture leave hand band compressor effect top effect underneath knob change leave tr tr beside panel go rack side gesture leave nord lead rack sit effect ensoniq dp go underneath couple korgs multieffects processor doepfer threeband analog sequencer knob assign knob pitch gate trigger whatever parameter control frequency cut synthesizer systemmodular synthesizer midi controller underneath adjust synthesizer another jxp gesture leave another sh beside system another dp plus eventide dsp another within armreach
nice able write track whatever think time along need turn feedback delay wash turn breakdown right front

music particular minimal techno music play amaze pa sound incredible every little pop crackle hiss perfect term monitor look

funny disagree little pop monitor pair monitor have find dj set club set watt subwoofer underneath
nice pair sennheiser headphone monitor monitor headphone suck never proper bass response pair headphone reason use monitor musicgetting play nightclub want listen minute long song home listen techno home listen public enemy nw shit whatever club though listen big room stretch arm indicate size academy lecture room echo reverb sit home nice pair monitor genelecs pick little pop little tick click speaker feel behind find good
jackin loud also lot low end always mix sub full range frequency also find mix pair genelecs good speaker responsive actually rhythm think cool little rhythm create minuscule exact speaker tune put club bunch reverb sudden anymore echo hear bassline chord drum good room nightclub arenmaybe big outdoor festival nice funktion soundsystem nice will hear great hopefully mix good enough mix crappy pair speaker nss instance reason standard mix sound shit sound car radio make sound good pair sound good anywhere
brother make many track awesome mix actually ten time good mix hear isnmastered boomy bottom low cut put yet compression sort master will help bring little fine point master engineer need worry much mix track ghettoblaster sony ghettoblaster driver big mix track track track have always nathan shit together spend money gear mix ghettoblaster have take mix ghettoblaster big club full range sound mix sound way tight mine mix pair crappy speaker need expensive monitor buy pair adams monitor nice nice pair monitor movie soundtrack far nightclub necessary drop amount money nice speaker sometimes ridiculous have much rather put gear effect processor compressor

now often play play live travel around world give us lowdown studio look gearwise fit plane scale take live man

play live use ableton live g bring motu mkii soundcard run ten out promoter rend either gl midas venice lowend highend midrange nice mixer rend importantly ask play live mixer channel less six auxiliary send midsweeps plus hopefully threeband two midsweep eq actually tune sound club sound halfgood
ask ensoniq dp basically effect processor run four different effect time combination whatever run reverb channel delay another maybe phaser chorus may change little normally leave time delay time reverb need club pretty much leave

obviously year collaborate people collaboration work enjoy collaborate

enjoy collaborate hard collaborate people music personal people everybody completely different method way write music hard lucky work people band work together sort argument studio shouldn happen
band geminis way time happen studio ridiculous get point us storm studio piss leave
work people learn system work instance way work band two us will studio time person three us many head studio try anything creative always person anything get bore whatever maybe start think else person time two people
also collaborate people especially electronic music sense especially use sampler amount hour tedious work use take time people aren sampler time annoy possibly deal sit make music wait two hour friend level every single sample work process sample make work
guy band paddy use sampler always probably time hour studio prepare live pa write track choose use sampler great love come work patience synthesizer play easy
dan rhodes player vocoder player want play even fast train keyboard player drop wait time studio put tv top organ have watch television have work keep mind focus wouldn piss us get bore whatever

ask approach remix believe bring remix shall listen

remix moby new album hotel track remix call slip away track almost slow contemporary rock ballad much basically take vocal chop put harmonic pitch basically drop vocal 5 guy familiar mobymusic big epic string put take string line chop make creepy evilsounding remix end use much personparts usually turn write track electronic music also remix much master either keep mind
music moby slip away focus people slip remix

say play actually remix

remix fun depend sometimes fun come close get right never happen write music sometimes good will come sometimes give remix even walk studio two day due couldn head around listen track hold people slip away personally push button actually make mad listen time respect mobymusic particular track hard think use part
decide think long time actually take part take computer studio play studio make mad make freak put headphone sit couch work work basically chop vocal basically make say focus people say focus people slip fuck seem little bite good say hang people sound creepy anyway shake head

yep decompression typerope think musically good call freedom engine itiswhatitis numb five weird story show mistake chaos come music make good let go
basically make track friend sit around studio couch hang jokingly program completely random musical influence maybe note choose know similar key together play black note totally cheat

say black note

black note keyboard play black note almost always sound good way combination white key pretty easy make minor chord augment minor chord play black note explain way sh work program note
completely randomly anyway count ths trigger put hold transpose hand hold right hand plug bunch note press play loop loop sing dananana danana hold transpose button keyboard keep hold start okay sound cool
try experiment completely random even sound arpeggio play have make sound okay note work transpose start different start play mary little lamb basic hear note transpose arpeggio whatever key kidsong play
actually come song awesome bassline actually sound sit write computer note note notation have whoa complicate actually come complete random note basically transpose different time work work certain transpose have try another note transpose eventually time song bar loop transpose key work right
way mix track actually train hold transpose button little finger play transpose note sing daaa dananana actually hard hear like completely different bassline train whole track way wasnrhythmic wasnanything wasn natural feel make sound intuitive awesome big deep track sound personal actually track actually make cry make master session listen hit chord weird experiment work whole time hand mimic play mix board write onechord swell lfo come basically mix mute fader change make development hand cool experiment weird never happen let chaos come come try hold onto technical theoretical knowledge music theory studio engineer theory try let affect much heavy think take away soul music important feel nerd mimic tweak hand hour hour

take away soul music now mention feel listen late production actually



totally technical part soul anymore

feel different everybody hear people say richienew also hear people say super deep talk plastikman close ep listen sound though another world personally relate disagree soul definitely doesnsound human also work

interest listen new production new experience obvious actually talk get film industry maybe also tell important improvisation hear story help richie regard mix technique experiment mix technique audio material ableton live

personally never actually watch richie mix track studio probably never let anybody usually tell interest technology start new label bring people go bring ricardo villalobos people friend release dvd cool even keep right track take track go release label mix somewhere else record whatever release dvd come studio mix surround stereo two amek board either side desk capable take track separate personally go write new write good label cool else moment sure

say big production lesson learn last year big piece advice give people

ah good

anything maybe last four five year figure sudden maybe obvious change whole way music sound

far last couple year lot little think big career far make music learn keep add top try back away even new track write part need strip bite
cloud frequency range right certain hank shocklee talk yesterday certain hold certain frequency range take away part bassline stick another bassline right top necessarily
have young have make oh cool have add key part another key part another harmonic part keep add good say unless sound every single part write track add sit listen feel okay add energy music make engage point get sharp muddy make
part part even note note ask add take away energy music notice trust way feel personally find write music physical feel tell part use track may even bunch part already maybe even slight little change volume bassline anything will sudden make everything come together track
actually feel though big energy ball right around whole body feel almost roll feel fall stand edge cliff lean actually fall feel uneasiness fall feeling
guy feel write music huge physical feel happen start trust intuition part putting put even feel whoa write complicate key part put top even though may theoretically may good ever write complicate chordwise progressionwise whatever hold throw sometimes doesnadd track technologynice crazy maybe record chuck live set maybe write around guess hold less bite unsure part doesnmatter work three day certain part work hold chuck every time throw garbage doesnmatter doesnmatter cool anything throw away right behind idea chain work doesnwork throw garbage go soon late find add certain energy certain feel music

another area incredible experience last year people room already release music many will go release music obviously start get area contract publish talk little bite contract experience fair deal
