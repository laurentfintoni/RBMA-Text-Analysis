radiophonic workshop already

leave radiophonic workshop join idea make
fortune commercial sound wasninterested commercial
sound philips whoooop
money
split succeed either
commercial studio want experimental studio good composer
work pay fact rather organization sort
philosophy anyone good project come work
studio wouldncharge wasn henze birtwistle
come quite often art council course perhaps people
come study month way similar
red bull music academy think

obviously judge retrospect amaze watch
documentary radiophonic workshop

amaze archive film idea exist
year ago extraordinary look think
actually happen

recall people public environment
publicly fund perceive like general public

radiophonic workshop purely sound effect radio s
become famous doctor
otherwise
primitive tape studio way research studio
buy instance ems equipment equipment never
advance way cologne
utrecht columbia wasn academic
research studio

customer time mention educational
broadcast facility mixedroles cologne facility
professor podmore able
tell still bizarre museum able
massive chunk money sink place else afford


mainly radio station university everybody buy little one
big synthi big version perhaps
someone come hold interviewer hold synthesizer way
around

gentle

synthi primitive first make huge
version call synthi think make

many still around obviously
picture

find anyone know pay money
sell fortune

see internet go sixdigit figure

tell think people talk
orphic

make german company now

ludwig rehberg
german agent fact robin wood studio assistant now own ems
start remake batch vcss exactly
original cost fortune whole idea
original have cheap musician buy sort


yes think say £ ad

vc yes

time obviously totally different £ now

half price car

half price car

small car

compare werenmany electronic


say want every musician able buy
end band pink floyd

sell several thousand several thousand buy
sort price moogs america bear mind
pocket calculator cost money telephone cost fortune mobile
telephone expensive fact much cheap now
doesnmean people wouldn buy

still feel now even late
actual financial fund obtain physical unit big threshold many
people music whereas now matter find free wifi computer

program computer still quite expensive

easy find another version steal physical unit

letsay powerful enough computer run good computer synthesis
program midi input quite
money couldn spend £ have need datum
storage have need peripheral cost two thousand
twohalfthousand pound

think people standard unit grand

input amplifier

amplification different people use headphone
look around

answer use lot record suite
people able come go highclass equipment much
good limit facility good equipment
bad equipment around also headphone hear
sound high quality program use
good facility still nothing
end begin computer
program terribly primitive mix program
midi incredibly naive sample still
naive still begin electronic music happen

sometimes feel overlook talk history
synthesis mostly talk warm sound get original
sound sort strike touch
unit first time actually inherent rhythm
within sound provide rhythmic element
straight away apply sort modulation oscillator

opposite rhythm

silence maybe interest people go
sound singlehit note oneshot note synthesize
sound movement within beauty use analog
equipment manipulate parameter rhythm
directly computer screen

think true
jono podmore
think true have agree find
aks vc
parameter touch immediately use
mouse trackpad use parameter time much
access part machine play numb
simultaneously much difficult current state
equipment

think right think david cockerell see
picture want make implant arm
day long time ago purely control voltagecontrolled
oscillator think have able think high note come high
note reason absolutely none train arm
couldnfind doctor true design

jono podmore
maybe put whippet

maybe think say right much good
multisensory input case need physical
two hand five finger
much good joke direct think computer
control

sure pretty aware lot experiment
last year find
current use brain low amplitude wouldn big
enough pickup recognize difference far less

yes direct brain rhythm talk talk
muscular

consciously control part body

think control learn learn control muscle
slight change voltage high
low frequency several move
different finger

advantage big brain information make
finger turn

have able turn

scientist house work now

think anyway forecast year ago talk
way year ago talk
another year say whatever acceleration

basically suggest go neuroscientist
intel

anybody have experiment

ray kurzweil sure re
familiar work talk scan
brain wifi connect synthesizer via chip
head seem idea people talk t
question

head somewhere else nose perhaps
think computer music begin make huge advance
first music program first computer synthesis
program advance time think rather
static phase moment produce program produce polish nugget sound without enough scope wild experiment feel may right invent completely new program use midi say york university

trevor wishart still york university work

sculpture show finance morning line
finance whole new research department several million pound
york university tony myatt annex fantastic facility good
record studio state art britain

excuse gush minute find map
libretto extremely freaky kid try figure
produce notice favorite track record numb
seven figure need reason listen
record cartesian plane time y value always s
rock record much rock soul record soulful
come exact curve good album
time late year film school learn classical
story structure exact curve freaky shit

numb seven aleister
crowley book seven
magic numb magic number doesnsurprise

anyway question first many question see much time
experiment try impose curve upon music
write cook whatever come perfect album s
say nonquantifiable perfect album
adhere perfect curve cater
unquantifiable make beautiful

inspiration think come back geiger counter luminous
watch random number important tame randomness
although randomness tame direction
unexpected inspiration tame unexpected
unexpected come randomness

compose write introduce randomness

suppose allow poet surely say random element
come paper every word preordain
must good idea good idea come maybe
sunshine case rise tide tide move
incredibly good inspiration pattern fluke
randomness let open let
come
jono podmore
point talk early reason
synthesizer synthi become popular day
analog nature degree randomness
behave put right numb right box
piece software run computer exactly
slightly random nature little bite grit carbon track
little bite inspiration come people grow
completely work domain

yes right new life electronic music
lucky new life wasn year ago now find
use real sound randomness come bit play
sample different sample vary randomness
trouble feel synthesizer sound
repetitive whereas gigantic sound orchestra two piece music
live performer ever take piece sheet music
two performance ever history identical
translation score idea completely amaze think
talk essence music always
unexpected say randomness
vibrato violin ever previous

another freaky also do similar experiment
little gm audio midi converter
box mean play
monophonic guitar line put random find sound see
synthesizer play rubbish now company
call melodyne allow able sample chord break part

already melodyne
produce
new version melodyne melodyne already
allow shift move chord stretch apart amaze
program amaze example show beethoven
transform recognizable remember tubular
bell choose still
recognizable beethoven although waveform midi completely
extraordinary

think question

sorry jump quickly seem talk
sound synthesizer randomness sound
seek old gear character touch
midi convert actual audio midi foresee time
digitize sound instrument think old
experiment hear
mellotron choir
close ever please sound convert electronic
now midi signal seem far away actual feel real
instrument

lovely piano life now yamaha clp steinway sample piano play back lovely lovely piano control midi come synthetic sample real piano lovely sound have
hard push say wasn piano new sibelius orchestra
sound good new version instrumental sound
especially sample one real sound will improve
actual amount gigabytes need sample large
space become fast memory even good now wonmatter big
sample able synthesize realistic sound
anyone agree

computer always
x amount number matter high set parameter
beauty early synthesizer love even though create
electronic sound always beauty randomness
put finger ever point
time computer

think head way computer listen sound
head hear differently time

probably

answer yes

give us example use image transform
score sibelius talk randomness importance
randomness music balance randomness order
suggest use device give example score okay
score base image make piece work
point

hope tell
isn answer question
million way wonderful say secret give piece paper love
piece paper

another question bite technical mention geiger
counter algorithm use back still little
still ringbased exactly insert random number
geiger counter

have sampler sample numb click give
geiger counter derive numb have list
number evergenerating list number have contain number
whatever way

sequence repeat

sequence never repeat always come forever

constantly use different

right come time usb geiger counter
come random number easy mathematics choose
number

use modulo
remainder

big device now easy t
think anyonemade nice little usb plug


think use online casino generate sequence

oh sequence sure nice self
contain sequence somebody else
online someone else use sequence long
random

never totally random purpose

us have

ah yes true okay

question
somehow match geiger counter personal dna somehow totally
independent

read morning
line month
come isn collaboration installation various artist
spain

yes five composer seville open now
another five istanbul

different version istanbul

yes fantastic extravagance sculpture cost £
refurbish cost £ refurbish cost £ move must move now seville northampton britain recover rewire refurbish cost £ send istanbul istanbul will last
month will cost £ send wherever another
composer extravagant wild artistic gesture ever do

read bite hear randomness
especially fractal nature actual sculpture artist
interest roc jiménez de
cisneros spain barcelona
interest electronic music record gas horn
york university maybe hear weird electronic
composition deal randomness replicate
randomness totally nonsynthesized way gas horn physical
instrument synthesizer physical
realm believe tendency postelectronic music
actually electronic use organic mean make different sound
probably hear nature believe tendency

yes immediately record sample electronic

doesn record replicate
live performance mp float around
right

lion bird unless recode
difficult originally sculpture
come year queen elizabeth hall london s
shape south bank decide difficult put
wheelchair access refuse
istanbul

another question workstation use
day western sense leave right write western
world think backlash towards

hope terrible look alike
similar person will say apple versus pc use use
marvelous revolution
different concept score leave right

yes believe young artist include putting
idea program learn use program
instead let idea flow

agree spherical interface ideal
tactile come back interface computer
linear door frustrate

yes even work structure hard

aren use ableton anyway



different dimension straight away aren

vertically structure
maybe come different background nonpop music

perhaps different scale see whole
different threedimensional way use think need revolution
write program seriously

good code try learn program
now baffle abstract

need david cockerell field concept need
someone screw

put online lecture now request put
email address stream

exactly happen interview
australian film call future sound
end say
wish find someone work immediately morning line
come york university come
film broadcast find people will come help

email address put

please contact moiseshhotmailcom

deal

pay give beer maybe

chance read book call zen art motorcycle maintenance

long time ago

look day concept classic
think versus romantic think classic much underlie form
work get nitty gritty break
part romantic side sound good cool essentially cover chaosversus
order randomness obviously brilliant mind
able invent language synthesis pretty amaze
translate music make knowledge
sense beauty

idea

okay

probably good lesson say
jono podmore
interest point friend touch early say
doesncome popular music background approach
sequencer whatever different reason appreciate
crowd work massive influence popular culture rather
highart academic university culture work now
see influence popular culture commercial
culture

fluke age opportunity
try new technique knowledge use
therefore way advantage able jump
care gather people together

email address now

haven must give participant will give
email address write people think good
revolutionize state play moment people
david cockerell say yes concept
jono podmore
feel remain academic culture
much great repercussion popular culture

think must popular culture say many people able
synthesize music way say people good
piano doesnmean good pianist piano
clever wonderful format use finger
sort wonderful format think yet
wonderful format make inventive electronic music
say isn isn wonderful device
control thought

question improvisation electronic musician guess
answer program perform

show score begin grand idea surprise
tension greyness dependency happen notion
inspiration music school hasn do yet will

think complete control back moises
say different way approach electronic music
able express concert pianist obviously
electronic realm

perhaps greatgrandchildren couldn

think next level improvisational electronic music

must depend good input device subtle
mouse keyboard

terrible

terrible

inaudible

monosyllabic way aren

already multitouch controller

magazine mention source look music library
wonderful extravagant magazine thick record
page different material animal fur touch touch
different think music music score
brilliant close eye touch different
score page lay touch
mean use different tactile make friend
want good input programmer maybe

use motion capture



put marker arm infrared camera take
movement make translate movement midi message
go image sound

language alright hundred mouse
good dancer infrared camera
mass information doesnmean
mass movement information make good music translation


think instead use implant motion capture

sound wonderful have love hear piece see
visual

another guess break
interest give little demo unit rest
will relieve lunch break

release

see total division people absolutely
other planet right now

sorry keep bring back corner term
touch different controller give control
variety different sound still think different
controller implant motion capture whatever make
complete control sound werenstill confine
bound control say western harmony

return question idea
possibly unknown technique
future hand boy say scotland

maybe hear first

good luck

guess probably perfect end future hand
join thank
