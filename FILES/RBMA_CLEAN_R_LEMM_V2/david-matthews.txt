hope

question advice someone doesn dig record anymore mean use go cratedigging whole anymore advice someone try talent theory young composer

find somebody know learn somebody teacher teach exactly hard find somebody study counterpoint hard write say good sure professional knowledgeable person say note doesn fit right somebody guide need somebody somebody young hate first start take composition lesson music school want write music

tedious

tedious teacher make write two threepart counterpoint two three year say now look big band write counterpoint anybodies ever hear year spend tedium counterpoint exercise way good nowadays sequence listen say hmm make feel whereas always plunk piano think need somebody guide go tedium way master way make music instead exercise

say drum machine beat ever sample kick

sampler

put drum machine whatever

never

okay guess haven term counterpoint theory find help listen sample find help talk ths ths different chord mean find theory learn now help term listen different sample chop necessarily steal loop take money pocket



support think relevant

idea answer sure way creative hear nowadays hiphop field people theory anything chord put together feel right may weird theoretically term much harmony counterpoint theory able transcend lock old rule gotta go beyond else hamper hold back take course year past feel now rule sleep without even think rule feel go beyond hold back young person careful master master leave behind
