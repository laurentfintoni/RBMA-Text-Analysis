hear week possible without pioneer work man gentleman sit next great privilege welcome mr

glad education already maybe talk late

go awful history cover even start talk physic yet information process week come figure may good chance two three minute let sink ready ready hmm audio ready
music unite state america love song dead che

wish anything may ask come talk synthesis heck play hippie psychedelic folky nonsense may actually information song way call love song dead che band call unite state america

oh gosh forget

believe two people pretty certain joseph byrd dorothy moskowitz tell us bite

first oberheim record record make oberheim synthesizer student ucla los angeles even though physic student always music department time have take class physic go back music department meet guy name joseph byrd incredible experimental music ucla mid wasnclassical music actually happening music late become pretty girlfriend name dorothy finish degree go computer engineer start band call unite state america last little year make two record band wasn interest people interest story oh important part story original band break always fight nowadays fight everybody happy day people fight break band singer start band different people original band device call ring modulator design guy never meet band break take ring modulator go start band come know engineer say build ring modulator begin oberheim build ring modulator lead

believe main reason sound first album 2 change

different

now obviously take grant day say oh physic degree build ring modulator actually find build

ha girl dorothy come say tom need build us ring modulator idea have computer engineer six seven year go ucla library spend several hour look book find book circuit diagram couldnfigure circuit interest musician anyway keep look finally find article magazine famous engineer originally germany move america design organ start design make electronic music even moog design modular wasn synthesizer design modular electronic music system ring modulator explain ring modulator use music take start make ring modulator

harald bide guy talk believe actually article inspire

good friend mr bide old guy early college begin think way bide mentor bob idea take circuit make module hook together patch cord course first moog synthesizer basic idea come bide moog add onto bring oscillator filter envelope generator birth analogue synthesizer combination two guy work

time many us grow much bear different manhattan slightly different big apple

ha ha bear small town center unite state state call kansas grow build stereo friend stereo invent build hifi friend start electronic junior high school build amplifier people late start much musician friend meet ucla

now radio absolute intricate fascination kid less fm radio turn dial weird frequency somewhere line split one look new station one take screwdriver take apart

think talk look eye someone today people will experiment electronic sound whether electronic think conventional wasn facility present experimental music today mean long time ago year ago go music school first learn bach learn beethoven take special interest people break experimental start slow everybody hear strange sound come fm radio ready make music take much time develop think

take step back year old literally take mumradio apart

experiment sound radio grow big band jazz have listen stan kenton band friend together play record different band see trumpet player play high note much late start experiment electronic actually make music wasn pioneer moog 2 generation take break interest conventional music interest talk talk arp

speak interest rumor many great include merle haggard share deep love train

yes friend mine use study o clock night have go train station wait train go chicago los angeles dream big city many year late whether cold winter day winter night have watch train go

dream big city nevertheless kansas state pretty renowned university

wasn great late become good day wasn interest music mean music late sure fugue counterpoint music student learn play piano whatever learn word fugue dave brubeck jazz album anything music high school study music late come different way normal piano lesson music school none listen record back still drive parent crazy record 9 grade sauterfinegan orchestra group early song play hour drive parent nut maybe may happen late

two people may feel yes



initial feel leave kansas behind west

say listen jazz high school decide go manhattan earn money go back college work school every day meet people old also day read magazine still existence mainly jazz call downbeat back magazine little ad different ad jazz club los angeles basically ad say come jazz club free now tell buy two drink think wow go hear great jazz musician pay ready go california someone say tom california say great wanna come go california never regret good move

la isnexactly small village earth go town center need anchor point navigate

arrive july pocket job parent money back kansas totally live cheaply day petrol cost quarter euro per gallon incredibly cheap couldnafford go good restaurant entertainment fill car break car barely run drive around los angeles learn city become taxi driver know city

profession choose

los angeles first work aircraft company first job find job pretty bore december year old see ad draftsman trainee job draw engineerdrawings company call national cash register big company america go apply job turn company early company computer business even computer lowly guy college degree yet high school give job little draft experience company first time see mixer see synthesizer hear music instantaneous love computer idea computer technology day course computer go wall computer think idea back university year old great time big city work company see engineer build incredible call computer think know go back college company let stay work parttime go ucla point plan anything computer engineer rest life work big company

quite job various wellknown company day

work six seven computer company guy job leave place work year computer company work three week boss leave ten year have seven job age resume show many job everybody say wrong good worker always leave say ah care fun job wasngood leave think common now wasn

now job take use major military provider lockheed nasa people nowadays seem underestimate connection sound synthesis military industrial complex

people think world understand essence art mean everything music paint poetry happening whatever maybe red bull exception typical company interest artistic side world interest make money rare connection art military industrial complex happen company successful throw little money art common us europe hear oh yes ibm sponsor museum course tiny fraction total income contribute art art stepchild society usually quite struggle people think

consider stepchild give us two example take military world technologically create art

first involve electronic music first maestro ring modulator late another pedal first start sell arp synthesizer first arp synthesizer dealer west coast characterize arp arp synthesizer maybe rich sound moog design engineer call alan r pearlman arp ten year design circuit military turn certain circuit need design industrial military purpose actually also useful synthesizer probably important know design oscillator drift love minimoog reputation drift problem think year go find solution pearlman experience design circuit industry know way design oscillator drift

now oscillator need actually pedestrian explanation

ring modulator

yes

okay ring modulator simple device make complex sound sure enough experience music enough appreciate call harmonic aspect music base overtone series think human being naturally attune word octave frequency ratio twoone major 5 frequency ratio close threetwo exist western music african tribal music idea fifth fourth octave universal human base frequency relate ratio ring modulator totally destroy ear attune change frequency absolute amount frequency let give example put hz tone side ring modulator hz tone side ring modulator have hz minus hz plus totally nonharmonic mind doesnfind nice pleasant sound yet always pleasant ring modulator destroy harmonic use hand great musician unfortunately bring ring modulator today early day sell ring modulator musician herbie hancock chick corea many people make great crazy sound ring modulator add subtract frequency rather multiply ratio happen

pretty sure short note say even understand still feel art aesthetic relationship design whatever whatever believe meet another person ucla challenge different side guy ellis people may different context

oh yes guy meet ucla jazz trumpet player name ellis go start innovative jazz big band become famous band song write arrange typically time time whatever people build equipment start oberheim ring modulator trumpet octave divider interest experimental music work also instrumental part get music unite state america ellis people see future subtle way ten year tire design computer ready else lead electronic music instrument

bring us little bring slide show

first commercial product call maestro ring modulator couldnfind picture electronically far box graphic much different company sell little bite adventurous go look wish picture first product great

maybe internet

look early today couldnfind interviewer go letterhead start oberheim company traditional way go company design logo letterhead show slide use write letter although never write many letter guy design logo big los angeles advertise art scene back comic comic art popular advertise many year ago roll stone always column guy call robert crumb main character big foot always stick call truck note truck ever hear phrase call truck note time great logo unfortunately long story late point original oberheim ring modulator logo front big beautiful explode graphic name oberheim explode typeface beautiful want conventional black silver

guess pretty mindblowing even detail logo people have rather film american splendor else roundabout way seem happen small entity despite big city

influence time start oberheim sick design computer have do ten year want guy design ad agency help far music wasn big advertisement agency spend lot money friend creative time idea ever successful company bedroom

start work quite decent job hour day go business

always work much work seven computertype company enjoy computer design interest profession people now do little chip do little individual part have several year experience work experimental musician excite part wasn perform musician instrumental musician joy musician friend talk late always drive force have make musician take create else ready leave computer even small make money happy

musician friend side game go business place go look investment may start neighbor

go around money friend enough start think total investment think money much start company business plan plan have able pay back anything wasn money

rumor thousand five six come neighbor

oh yes talk mean first investor guy work company secret work us government war game study happen soviet union attack unite state many bomber have need respond crazy political world unite state turn upside friend neighbor mine go public call pentagon paper basically tell story defense department us government show war vietnam disaster everybody think win war document come within us defense department actually say way win war guy make public neighbor friend help point company help logo design letterhead design paper xerox machine pentagon paper print course yearold story interest people remember horrible time crazy war sound today america crazy war hear

start wonder give money back right court case

come year invest sum say tom need investment back say fine give back last time ever see next time hear anything someone knock door say hello mr oberheim fbi see mr russo guy name tony russo say see many month find late us government come guy make paper public friend helper fbi knock door

day sell record now back little quite phone call especially los angeles film capital

right probably decide start business design particular ring modulator design specifically perform musician design ring modulator early version learn make word around music community los angeles call ring modulator phone call movie composer say movie use ring modulator movie soundtrack soundtrack movie call beneath planet ape take ring modulator studio use soundtrack break several people movie orchestra come say oooh buy start business

see every night street cerveza beer have go approach people original merchant

quite understand

faceface business stage

yes make local musician los angeles decide go make ring modulator time think begin rackmount type decide time music pretty much jazz think history book say start mile davis start late forget album insist chick corea keith jarrett two famous keyboard player play play acoustic piano want play fender rhodes piano turn sound musician discover become popular time electronic music start hear synthesizer record possible time take synthesizer road unless course keith emerson roadies big truck small synthesizer yet start sell ring modulator people use fender rhodes piano record wasnable find today either herbie hancock chick corea play solo fender rhodes ring modulator

within jazz community cause similar reaction bob dylan play electrify guitar newport folk festival

think crowd reaction dylan play electric guitar little different sure keith jarrett play electronic say interview hate electronic think jazz musician experimental work ring modulator immediately make musical accept case dylan example wasn much musical rejection hero play electric

big part business time another object similar size explain phase shifter

oh still meet musician ucla friend late call folkrock call first meet lead eagle whatever people need electronic device traditional music record build sound amplification equipment question

phase shifter

oh group musician still high school first start work try everything discover listen george harrison play guitar leslie speaker remember beatles song recently read great book engineer make beatles recording friend fascinate idea instead play guitar amp play leslie rotate organ speaker think great sound think great sound look another product start experiment make long story short find circuit call phase shifter circuit simulate sound swishy sound leslie speaker time sell ring modulator big market company take phase shifter interest next three four year sell hundred thousand phase shifter mxr company first phase shifter market put business point now enough money

fun



mean quite transition solder together circuit friend sell many unit say

three four year hundred thousand time company three four people take four year excite say america bean rice mean little money buy much actually start make money company excite time

time talk everything handmade workshop

place day oberheim onefourth size room two three people day have make phase shifter good time

long work recreate mean sound conveyorbelt work

make ship door bore work time phone call someone herbie hancock jan hammer say tom love phase shifter work hour way year make electronic music make sell make money hear late play music oberheim even today still thrill build process always use engineer knowledge love music first step build instrument process finish start process process end machine make hand musician complete process even simple phase shifter part process feedback great musician come say tom love love ring modulator love phase shifter course late wasn turn crank thrill still fun

feel bite unleash sonic nuke

guess people room arenlooking forward great lawyer great business manager big company make music make music hard explain people case make music part process case process fulfill excite play music make instrument either go hear musician play start lp cd letface everybody world creative good different people otherwise job insurance company bank whatever important climb ladder success important case hit synthesizer have hit record sure still process different us drive different power think

now deal different power dayday basis sudden face reality first namm show

look back now year late seem happen rather quickly ring modulator phase shifter able go trade show part process build happen overnight rarely happen fast work mean design sell trade show meet musician mean

try imagine arp also sell someone trade show imagine quite different anaheim frankfurt music fair

ring modulator phase shifter look way make little money keep company start become arp dealer think refer show arp trade show sell los angeles different musician studio musician movie jazz people start sell rock musician early sure answer look

interest hand go show still interest see atmosphere represent build hand whereas pretty alright probably let benefit different level

first start trade show namm show see people first oberheim product sell big company chicago sell have go trade show see people different pedal synthesizer start idea sure quite

way find

mean synthesizer synthesizer accept movie music pioneer guy los angeles synthesizer expert wasn designer user real introduction synthesizer around remember talk synthesizer work beach boy synthesizer know theremins good vibration point whooowhooowhoooo guy good vibration theremin group people la middle people start use synthesizer start grow part big contributor yet see develop grow guy idea ever see movie say sound thx think company come together fat harmonic chord poor copy guy two large moog synthesizer make hair stand end hear good version record friend early bring sound alone great anyway name paul beaver pioneer learn think spark want involve synthesizer begin show make think interest

help us bite recall moment stand arp whether front software classic analog piece button fader create sound use general technique find way maneuver around surface

day oberheim start build synthesizer young engineer come say tom build synthesizer say okay explain basic analogue synthesizer patch call basic patch say mean basic patch say okay goodbye now real philosophical talk relate physic whatever

cliffsnotes version

okay take arp minimoog large moog analog synth place start work simple two oscillator choose different wave form may track keyboard depend adventurous two oscillator go simple twoinput mixer voltagecontrolled filter voltagecontrolled filter go voltagecontrolled amplifier envelope generator modulate filter envelope generator modulate vca
mean take everything two oscillator mix vcf two envelope generator vca make incredible analog synthesizer music power analog synthesis idea basic patch simple understand mechanical point view oscillator oscillator filter vca envelope generator envelope generator hear synthesizer music analog synthesizer music essence everything else windshield wiper car need nice
basic patch understand understand make good sound essence analogue synthesis simple learn read obscure little book actually arp owner manual talk page understand basic everything else add basic patch make great sound

obviously chance go eight million different tangent quick show hand want oneone element waveform interest yes maybe late okay good half take

keep mind basic two oscillator filter vca two envelope generator now three oscillator always expand come waveform waveform orchestra difference flute violin flute violin clarinet case sawtooth square wave sinewave now easy concept change waveform change quality havenchanged basic patch still oscillator filter envelope modulation little different quality change waveform sawtooth pulse sound move time modulate keep mind basic patch change little element

probably graphic karaoke version mean oscillator first start

good way make awful synthesizer sound work oscillator always two need three three add little first basic lesson learn less think try make good sound two oscillator overall write quality different filter

filter actually mean letstart simple say sine wave

sine wave good example

go amateur teach us

idea behind filter change overtone come high end open filter mellow sound low filter important modulate filter make filter set move time envelope generator lead sound hear especially early synthesizer day another filter add call resonance make little peak sound use envelope change filter frequency resonance turn famous pweeeeeeoooooww sound use probably much add see creativity musician use come together make real music

late machine credit fat warm sound category apply engineer sense

course deal year make synthesizer oberheim certain sound minimoog certain sound never hear good engineer explanation minimoog sound good say lesser synthesizer engineer point view probably complex analyze whether minimoog filter oberheim filter little bite distortion way harmonic subtract change filter frequency explain engineer point view ear much sensitive sound many way use piece test equipment studio people say never use mixer sound analog fader people still ear brain much sensitive engineer instrument

mention moog late robert moog much argue still part ghost man make machine

quite although east coast guy west coast guy see often bob person forget warm funny guy wasn snob go drink two fun quality have think similar quality know engineer quality appreciate result engineer work mention wonderful music come great musician use equipment mean great fame mean great devotion
course know good friend keith emerson remember story keith emerson emerson lake palmer day keith use big moog impossible take tour need roadie full time keep still moog able understand keith appreciate keith great user whether minimoog whatever able take knowledge engineer love music continuously refine process make machine sound great have think success think tell difference fat synthesizer fat synthesizer
wonmention name think ultimately hmmm isnnecessarily good say people draw different musical element even though machine now doesnmean clean without distortion mean maybe right amount distortion persontaste maybe lot distortion somebodytaste hard explain term classic analog synthesizer sound moog able partially design love music understand music big analog synthesizer sound bwwwoooooooow sound bottom die maybe good hear wall shake understand

element hiphop east coast west coast hate wack competition even give prop name

wasn much think east coastwest coast hiphop think year know synthesizer know love now hand creative musician presume even bad synthesizer planet become effective tool still certain love way sound may love completely different drive work hour day year year love every minute solder iron hand think oooh look great circuit hear hear someone take great sound make make music clasp chest still think different kind synthesizer make different sound classic period may say learn many case look now hear use new music people make oh realize make great sound education admit love make synthesizer big fat sound happen happen fortunately people planet happen fun

part two hiphop analogy place tough competitor market place seem awful respect certain key player

start synthesizer late main competition arp never competitor time build oberheim arp pretty much business still point time claim fame first polyphonic synthesizer buy music store fame couple year prophet come along pretty much almost put business push onto day sequential circuit run guy name sell everything make sell everything make technically competitor wasnever problem roger linn good friend lm linndrum dmx sell pretty much everything build yes competitor wasn take sale away coexist now hiphop world coexistence work maybe friendly

close little hiphop trilogy guy meet nowadays call dead president society institution back

exist roger dave synthesizer business frantic race utilize late technology technology change fast look back synthesizer business ten year look first synthesizer ten year late technologically different have maybe meet trade show dinner together busy try next good make enough profit keep company worry technology whatever time meet often social run scare us small company time look shoulder japan time japan get synthesizer business worry always run fast time social

japanese enter game bob despite respect different view polyphony

oh

first explain

synthesizer make monophonic play note put five finger keyboard have note sound lot pitch still note do experiment friend mine experimental composer los angeles fantastic keyboard improviser improvise theme take audience first half concert 2 half hook ring modulator revox tape recorder tape echo have live electronic music concert bring two monophonic synthesizer build little circuit board within arp allow play two key two pitch two voice two oscillator play two pitch still go filter vca take two concert set play simple fourpart bachtype even though extremely crude carefully set synthesizer sound pursue sound great hear polyphonic music synthesizer although practical yet back mind lead year late true polyphonic synthesizer

polyphony monophony sentence

ability play note time fourvoice polyphonic synthesizer play four note whereas minimoog arp play note difference think synthesizer stay monophonic wouldn nearly interest world today less

nevertheless understand bobstance towards

way come synthesizer idea synthesizer make complex sound overdub add together famous switch bach put synthesizer map bob concentrate early day make instrument musician go tour perform musician course say early enough resource take big modular moog road have roadie goal begin ring modulator phase shifter build equipment musician tour equipment carry place another wasn lock studio say ad take studio stage always think term studio overdub wendy carlos switch bach need polyphony overdubbing someone want play polyphonic synthesizer tour overdub obviously

guess favorite quote context god mean sing polyphony give voice

guess give us finger

late argue give us next important topic design interface interface use keyboard

interest invention synthesizer wasnexclusively invention time bob invent synthesizer new york another engineer also see coffee thursday call also invent synthesizer time independent moogphilosophy make relate conventional musician point view black white regular conventional keyboard buchla believe still doesn day much build synthesizer interface various kind touch keyboard nontraditional controller idea way people go direction go another direction

see indicate slideshow

okay oberheim four voice polyphonic synthesizer put map way synth bear develop little synthesizer module see four module machine idea module among fatten sound add sound say minimoog arp synth slightly different sound moog arp parallel together slightly different sound originally module module implement sound exist machine remember experiment friend several year concert crude polyphonic day decide january idea put four eight module together simple keyboard first polyphonic synthesizer module already existence make decision take six week design machine late take year design six week actually matter survival point time company chicago sell lot phase shifter ring modulator pedal time also day january call say tom time bad business isngood cancel order sudden real business say maybe time come polyphonic idea take module already put four together keyboard month late show namm show oberheim synthesizer world bear desperation sometimes need push along do tomorrow good do normally wouldn lot time

guess time probably listen little medley put together
music pat metheny
music doobie brother fool believe
music gary wright dream weaver
music rush tom sawyer
music stanley clarke strange weather
music weather report birdland
music van halen jump

obviously time parent couldn machine guess none mean many unit sell

polyphonic many day

rate

else mean trwerensitting use music store whatever weren first track play medley pat metheny group popular jazz group existence almost year popular see pat metheny year ago concert give fantastic concert people want say hello leave wait around talk say tom start group oberheim take last money paper round help pay oberheim think tell torsten know tangerine dream early day buy oberheim early day oberheim polyphonic visit berlin many time concert take every pfennig whatever put gear yes expensive else people find way sure find way must course different mix say mainly orient towards perform musician play club go tour early day werenrich expensive

find 2 generation use secondhand market revive gear

general simple sense synthesizer world go analog early become digitalized dx machine mainly japan kill analog think time company make analog synths computer powerful now go plugins different thread along will come will go another will come along assume see dx first synthesizer real popular come scene explode five year late dead analog become popular late searly die come go big die continual process time buy oberheim ebay buy oberheim nothing fourvoice now course little different think cycle probably another five year nobody know continually cycle

even cycle depend mean may mean terribly different depend little example boy use oberheim local church fat organ sound quite different
music x sonic destroyer

guess idea now maybe necessarily design machine first place

oh absolutely true first time hear track come today wouldnnecessarily music have listen day long love great suppose hear different context go around listen song think oh oberheim listen music listen music fact oberheim great instrument make know process isndone whether pat metheny soft jazz almost symphonic way completely different genre feel now wonsay everything hear every music agree think emotion build give musician everyone soft jazz thank goodness

pretty direct way guy influence heavily another artist strong relationship speaker hum

think oberheim
music stevie wonder village ghetto land

okay let talk oberheim matter fact although oberheim story fact big monstrous lb yamaha machine call c think stevie wonder song key life time make album friend america producer write column magazine call mix ever read mix magazine okay record studio magazine friend write anyway know stevie wonder early day develop oberheim take studio hollywood stevie song key life meet stevie coincidentally first prototype oberheim take studio stevie love now hear c use late oberheim buy wow first sale stevie wonder never hurt sure song use song key life sure use thank torsten play connect c wouldn carry c studio anything else weigh lb crazy machine two three ever make think thank

two

two maybe make ten forget now monster interest ultimately studio stevie ever say engineer say stevie learn oberheim much good sound yamaha now yamaha capability sound encourage

think first time see word oberheim back stevie record popular record mother much first sight turn around see ooh different song flip side next song picture stevie sit castle keyboard middle oberheim everything write braille

oh sure also good play paint panel learn word little mark fader type feel mark program couldnsee end look sound

two guy also crazy electronic always tend mix name larssitting audience bitte

tontoexpanding head band

oh couple guy los angeles make monstrous analogue synthesizer name crazy guy bob margouleff producer early stevie wonder guy malcom cecil many different synthesizer call tontoexpanding head band arps little oberheim moogs big monstrous think take steviestudio though move

now start sound sort circuitry chef kitchen hand people enjoy feast role people play middle

first let say day circuit design expert genius circuitry although people look fame invent synthesizer engineerpoint view circuitry admire say early work another engineer guy bide come original idea patch cord moog filter love people talk minimoog filter start big moog modular bobinvention transistor level genius oberheim consider great circuit guy help case part oberheim module design engineer arp another design engineer e guy start e originally start company build modular synths invent sampler help invent sampler help spend time putting module together make less partially playable human wasnalways easy

awful haveneven go near yet definitely miss talk synths probably isn difference people little connect screen see dmx drum machine tell us learn build synths implement drum machine

story guess dmx polyphonic synthesizer business three plus year someone mention guy name roger linn invent programmable drum machine wonder probably werenexposed early day hammond organ make little box play electronic tango crap horrible nothing have ever listen long hear programmable drum machine guy roger linn hadnmet think programmable make rhythm real drum sound genius idea turn roger la day la invite office day people business roger rock roll guitar player idea talk say together make sell pay royalty say start company roger go start company linn electronic first product lm late linndrum think absolutely connect synthesizer synthesizer two go together come drum machine call dmx

first midi understand midi wasn sole invention either different people involve right

wasn many people involve idea midi start founder sequential circuit prophet now back business idea call midi way hook synthesizer together use signal first present idea technical conference late expand start work roland midi wasn many people basically guy sequential roland work now course midi everywhere work couple engineer roland guy engineer now everywhere first wonder work year software engineer find way make work pretty use daveanother good friend doesnlive san francisco coffee thursday life maybe two hour away see every talk old day talk happen now people think coffee electronic music people talk electronic music talk osx work program oh work letcall friend apple talk coffee talk synthesizer

tackle differently sell machine contain handful sound instead machine give almost infinite possibility

time dmx linndrum come market drum synthesizer couple company england us werensuccessful think time whereas synthesizer program sound differently change people want real drum sound real drum say cater make instrument travel musician wongo philosophy tell drummer go hell although happen extent whatever reason people want real drum sound weren interest synthesize drum hard synthesize real powerful drum sound although doable tr prove sound tr arenrecorded take work make sound good easy recording play back fairlight entity understand fairlight sample begin wasn big yet know basically market want real drum sound synthesize mindset little different listen track detroit guy mean drum make happen never hear think drum synthesizer available power people want never become popular record sound people want less perceive time

todaynerd perspective absolutely fantastic need burn little chip change sound imagine time build devastate

people make different drum chip time eventually make product oberheim burn drum chip call prommer wasn successful company spring garage work little company buy drum chip fact exactly digidesign start two guy garage build drum chip linndrums oberheim drum machine idea harddisk record course now digidesign monstrous

do quite alright

do okay

ever think chip give grant

drum chip business record hard disk big step first successfully

probably beatheads probably run couple oberheim drum sound load will recognize anywhere lionel richie run dmc back play selection oberheim drum sound play round spot drum now anyone yell name play selection obviously sad sample rendition another feel actual instrument hand

hear play seem little clean dmx

little bite

early early day sample circuitry necessary high quality sample expensive day cd record wasn popular yet make fairly crude record dmx popular successful product obviously people like hear guess still use although eight nine month ago take dmx attic put trash think have never need bring raffle

pretty nice auction guess company late crucial point touch upon open floor stage walk street shop see oberheim product wasn anymore lose name lose child

slightly different emotion let first say havenever actually walk music store see oberheim wasnmine talk metaphorical way may ask stop much american story make brief essentially happen start company hire lawyer basic company decide want make corporation lawyer make corporation paperwork year go advice oberheim big oberheim trouble financially develop matrix big expensive machine have do basically werencareful finance pretty much run money
go lawyer have know year trust give advice first month lead push company edge bankruptcy wasn oberheim wasnmaking profit take profit use buy part matrix run money course big mistake conservative matrix ever see big machine voice polyphonic etc etc anyway lawyer convince plan even though oberheim wasn continue way plan tell follow plan bank oberheim owe money probably shut oberheim also take house
think wasn happy wife go advice complicate legal involve lawyer understand make sense make long story short end buy asset oberheim bank plan talk have partner new company own asset oberheim never happen
work year half also talk people oberheim also little work patent patent attorney help patent go lunch day tell happen say screw wow think great guy never do course history end oberheim drain readily available money leave oberheim give gibson future royalty oberheim name oberheim logo gibson now own oberheim name
sad story end oberheim nothing ob oh several make gibson also make viscount nothing far concern oberheim product

go found marion seasound probably interest people ultimate scenario mistrust everything always fear oh stinky lawyer call american story way europe everyone incredibly afraid ever bankrupt ever otherwise immediately need commit harakiristyle suicide whereas seem

happen

find strength brush try

love think make point rich thrill make instrument whether guy detroit eddie van halen whoever never meet eddie van halen hear thrill see particular song whatever start new company build new synthesizer fast right wasn success take retirement synthesizer business also business become uninteresting
business become workstation japan interest start hear bit piece new consider new look career engineer year electronic music year djproducer call new hear start hear interest music course hear music know name easy say jazz everybody know jazz easy say rock roll heavy metal whatever hard say people many little name enough music difference bass drum next still discover hear music synthesize love synthesize music yesterday joel play piece lp italian group fantastic hear now oberheim think say do oberheim even synthesizer oberheim love synthesize music many different state start problem fast prove world good job machine wasn success now thank red bull inspire see different way synthesize music go may know
stand ovation
good place end huh

pretty sure awful question ask sure deal interim stand ovation

sure do fine

feel question quite bite time

oh hope consider god afraid ask anything hope make point love whether home lab design circuit talk musician love feel free ask whatever

hello thank share knowledge little question first polyphonic synthesizer wonder decide put four module together three five six

reason first decide concept make expandable expensive start fourvoice late expand sixvoice eightvoice now three versus five always curious prophet come five voice strange maybe five voice dunno case circuitry several level work pair another machine time fourvoice call twovoice two module basically engineer decision couple level work pair basically want make expandable person buy four late expand

thank

hello wonder play keyboard

instrumental performer

performer house work ever tempt play surround product make

um reason way process start start work start immediately meet great musician play herbie bother think much learn keyboard player composer band leader happy engineer hear people never play mean always try change change circuitry think sound right have play music

couple bore announcement make absolutely say big thank share us mr please
