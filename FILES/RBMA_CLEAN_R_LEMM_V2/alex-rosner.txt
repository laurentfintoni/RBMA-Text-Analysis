frequency work

sound compose wide range frequency low frequency bass note high frequency high note human hear range approximately hz low frequency sort feel range roughly khz old hear good high end human speech fall range around hz overtone bulk frequency range midrange speech instrument much great range separate sound instrument high frequency nice soundsystems reproduce entire range errorfree frequency intensity throughout range difficult ideal loudspeaker loudspeaker reproduce entire frequency range company england try remember name company fiveinch loudspeaker make hornloaded cabinet able produce bass also high high go high enough reproduce high need small unit big focus sound much reproduce low move air big piston hard loudspeaker everything
speaker gesture genelec speaker lecture room break setup three range bass midrange high crossover network determine high frequency middle low send frequency different loudspeaker driver particular unit actually three separate amplifier woofer midrange high three independent amplifier crossover network amplifier elegant way putting engine right top wheel car easy control audibly isnmuch difference method use amplifier crossover crossover merely device take sound take high frequency send way take middle frequency send way take bass send 3 way

frequency air movement relate

oh forget soundsystems moment sound voice modulate air mean push air around molecule air travel air reach ear ear make head tail sound travel soundsystem loudspeaker move air back forth modulate air get personears
energy sound low frequency low frequency need power high frequency tweeters need little power loudspeaker need power
direct driver loudspeaker mean sound come front make system whereby feed horn horn amplify acoustically sound bass driver much efficiency bass horn loudspeaker driver give acoustic power driver alone driver alone give clean power assume amplify power drive bass horn horn arrangement usually need corner much large enclosure efficiency need much power power go long way
