guest today germany munich specific constructor electronic instrument musician play couple people perform equipment equipment modify various record release also go tour back artist live act synths sequencer select couple tune history electronic equipment pick couple people think influential work

whenever somebody get involve electronic music first major difference play acoustic instrument opportunity choose equipment say okay steinway piano rather b√∂sendorfer gibson guitar rather fender choice play guitar play piano pretty much instrument electronic music totally different doesnmean everybody build instrument certainly mean everybody somewhat serious electronic music aspect electronic music even say relate djing true certainly true relate produce make track make electronic music
part train grow electronic musician choose instrument use sure everybody know zillions tool around now software hardware kind strange little strange use life short now probably many program many different piece hardware thousand maybe ten thousand different piece equipment software possibly use try express electronic music obviously use make choice use order make choice little possibility limitation strength weakness various instrument say always interest understand abstract concept actually get learn program learn machine
people start interest electronic music time possibility already exist commonplace commonplace look back history electronic music people start electronic music little early force design less somebody design equipment simply equipment store go say hey need hippest sampler hard drum machine business exist pioneer electronic music design instrument simply necessity wasnanything around detail work talk two pioneer electronic music particularly influential electronic music general work particular american guy name raymond scott may hear german guy name oskar sala letstart short track raymond scott record purely acoustical
music raymond scott quintette microphone music

cut splice nothing play begin end guy bring quintet life raymond scott start swing bandleader early try technique equipment available nevertheless try technique modern remixer much attitude dj today record rehearsal band onto record tape recorder time cut record every rehearsal take record back home sit five gramophone record player needledropping listen various part various track rehearse band since technical way splice write okay bar seventeen track like bar five nine track go back next rehearsal band play track come
pretty successful quintet make quite money war actually way make money walt disney license track use soundtrack cartoon make money allow pursue major interest beside music electronic start try build design construct instrument allow go beyond possibility acoustic swing quintet basically war year afterwards spend long rehearse quintet play swing music sit home solder
reason pick sort influential designer constructor inventor electronic music fascinate sequence early first actually think sequence another way say player piano sequencer raymond scott try build machine allow compose music beyond capability human player beyond capability normal acoustic music actually start build machine basically sequencer build relay electromechanical switch take year turn wall rack literally meter foot long twometer high inch rack meter long wall sound call time

actually ibm time also spark plug think even medicine

cough medicine

cough medicine everything relate science chemistry physic people actually underlie commercial electronic music play love spark plug car listen sound choose make order visualize spark plug spark car spark plug commercial think around

probably somewhere late s

late early autolite spark plug commercial
music raymond scott manhattan research autolite spark plug

use equipment actually make sound spark plug actually spark tzzz tzzz hear sound time mean go anyone say make sound spark plug mean find people actually probably america time actually capable produce electronic sound time

probably first example hear interest create electronic sound also say interest sequence may sound little stupid call bipibip bipibip spark plug sound sequence fact try somewhat automate process create electronic music mean today call sequencer basically sort first example actually use play another course talk upfront listen voiceover much listen background ibm commercial also probably
music raymond scott manhattan research ibm mtst paperwork explosion

check sequence background think agree music without voiceover make cool dance remix loop hear background right say commercial wasnintended club use anything make completely different consider hip modern whatever around even aesthetic around particular interest program music sense us today computer computer around look machine allow compose music couldn compose wasninterested use synthesizer wasneven call synthesizer time letuse term anyway wasnlooking machine imitate sound violin try make sound make music couldn do say begin way electronic solder iron develop design build
quickly change pioneer want introduce german guy call oskar sala also bear around time raymond scott early th century raymond scott bear think sala sure approach little bite different music student berlin play piano study composition classical composition classic composer modern classic composer may call hindemith germanjewish composer late emigrate unite state obvious reason around bunch people also physic professor berlin university call trautwein guy build exact opposite raymond scott try raymond scott try say preprogram automate music meanwhile oskar sala interest create electronic instrument play physically bodywork involve play guitar play piano anything definitely different alley raymond scott never interest preprogramming sequencer anything interest find build design instrument expressive
video oskar sala play trautonium

think 2 movie

play sort modernize version instrument build basically technical concept
video oskar sala unknown

wire span across metal rod depend position hit control pitch fairly simple since lot people build controller ribbon controller allow advantage disadvantage time learn play learn fretless bass violin learn hit right note isn easy normal keyboard play vibrato move around play glissando slide regular keyboard
also play may enough musical train hear hear intone wasnequaltempered big difference interval sound little strange ear today use listen equaltempered music electronic keyboard buy today basically equaltempered start say play instrument take year probably decade even master instrument control pitch subtly musically also control volume subtly musically may see rod push wire move downwards say probably strange design mechanism ever see music

try play

course look fool

sit audience swedish folk instrument basically string actually play string seem

pluck string

pluck string mean course also hit hard old grand piano instrument call spinet whatever difference

string doesncreate sound

okay

use control electronic circuitry control pitch oscillator electronic circuitry

play spinet basically happen press hard sound press

right come mechanism mention translate pressure voltage control volume

okay

machine fix frequency key also envelope anything way sound shape volumewise attack fade play play amount pressure put mechanism need rehearsal train spend year sort little bite recognition work last year life people approach say gee sound great teach learn say tell build instrument
consider electronic musician engineer capability definitely intention say work solder iron electronic electronic composer sure necessarily today anymore people start sort look instrument try figure quickly recognize fascination go music physical capability guy develop year hack around string strange instrument today everybody instant gratification mean result fast people find difficult long take learn say okay pass think go buy regular roland whatever

actually take concert hall perform live piano player perform stage actually composition play instrument fill

big concert hall

big concert hall time s

actually fill concert hall already dark time 3 reich since wasnjewish emigrate manage continue musical work nazi time little strange also necessarily music may happen sort put pressure play german manage continue work instrument throughout war war fact end play instrument come mostly fact hard learn take much time understand circuitry understand will happen actually manage play musical way
sound effect hitchcock bird sound background also produce exact machine see hear example
video alfred hitchcock bird
now come fun part early now people start develop instrument two week ago start design oskar sala brave enough almost say ignore equipment come afterwards never minute think get moog sort keep technology think personally look back work life think main reason develop mastership instrument concentrate waste time read manual buy new equipment store bring back box take month find weren look ignore completely technical development come start broad basis early think show quite character today people electronic music sort start look around use use okay music buy equipment use music try equipment
find instrument piano player like piano player wonthink buy guitar need pretty much approach think develop skill unique instrument capable produce music nobody else world ever produce think today generic tool toy gadget disposal want successful happy electronic musician electronic composer major part life develop specific develop style course also develop certain type mastery equipment will never develop constantly keep buy late instrument pick instrument use will major influence music make depend production environment choose whether dinky little casio keyboard software whether inherit million go buy doesnmatter matter use will influence style
develop unique style unique music unique setup doesnmean unique sense build 2 world mean usually today use instrument use whole box combination box way use box point become unique otherwise people rest life tempt begin go copy software friend start work order find tool whether software hardware appeal whatever reason reason rational mean instance certain synthesizer way look certain synthesizer way feel way knob feel touch dislike other reason look shitty feel good necessarily musical reason say look instrument matter finish track see instrument anymore make music irrational big problem computer computer rational computer always force less rational every ten second every twenty second think menu will find certain option think make music make electronic music nonrational stay way good real musician sense word make music irrational rational reason eat doesnkeep warm obviously need obviously need listen music suppose people feel need make music
engineer look certain piece equipment say okay do way problem cheap good businessman say okay sell many thousand concern make music electronic music concern find tool allow become intuitive difficult become intuitive computer see people say computer wrong way say use computer tendency will music will emotional intuitive say constantly switch back rational mode order find right menu submenu

compose totally different story

wouldnsay totally different story classical music may enough welltrained people capable imagine say string quartet play score without actually hear less good train classical composer anticipate will sound unfortunately fortunately depend look electronic music case even synthesizer equipment hard anticipate sound will program tweak knob listen make electronic music always sort conversation sort dialogue machinery good interest equipment electronic music equipment talk talk mean unexpected
