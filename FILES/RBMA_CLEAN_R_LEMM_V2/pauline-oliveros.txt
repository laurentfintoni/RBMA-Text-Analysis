oh

story mort invent must tell

morton watch

mort inventive first time hear story come totally wall true

beautiful past colorful peopleminds isn

day will write

involve build instrument start assemble machine sort

say instrument build interface design programmer program maxmsp first totally analog interest distance record head tape machine playback head little distance mean delay okay monitor time record head playback head monitor possibility change amplitude say playback record head open begin reverberation fascinate hear work eventually start string tape machine 2 machine signal put pass two playback head couldn two record head erase already possibility route signal say 2 playback head back first back 2 create kind interest rhythmic configuration pretty evident piece mine call bye bye butterfly

listen

okay answer question consider expand instrument system now still use use last night concert instrument environment instrument play play back

will back eis expand instrument system bite bye bye butterfly

tape music center

yes

rent space divisadero street san francisco divisadero location think small concert hall seat people build subscription audience tape music studio upstairs nicesized room big equipment day miniature today mixer yet large telephone patch bay passively mix sound letsee think two big machine donate ampex tape music center various item pretty basic consider call classical electronic music studio build equipment never intend make music equipment test laboratory
sound hear bye bye butterfly make tube oscillator way make invent way make electronic music time set oscillator range hear say around hertz difference two three oscillator use tube oscillator look big dial center face possibility set range go range hear certain range hear range hear way change pitch sound turn dial necessarily good way make music set oscillator range hear learn accordion teacher teach listen difference tone difference tone difference two frequency produce difference also range hear low difference tone first hear difference tone sound corroborate way add tape delay system use bye bye butterfly way play oscillator barely turn dial reduce aspect oscillator play able sense want improvisational way listen come listen intently perform sound interest layer sound take tone microscopically vary side band call simple setup actually produce complex result

another piece work difference tone iv

yes university toronto montréal sorry toronto last week

country though

summer program numb composer come learn electronic music university toronto good classical electronic music studio time summer tape music center ragtag studio put together good possible utms twelve lafayette oscillator tube oscillator connect key keyboard necessarily interest able say put weight key keep tone sound play oscillator way bye bye butterfly iv also fourchannel piece do studio go want learn electronic music also study hugh le caine hugh le caine wonderful engineer make first electronic instrument play good summer piece come

letlisten bite iv
music iv

thank thank thank thank

mention hugh le caine work toronto instrument developer another instrument developer come san francisco tape music center work interest work point interest synthesizer

wasn certainly great respect pass away recently morton ramon advise happen try connection different engineer see modular synthesizer accord specification interest work collaboration produce buchla modular synthesizer demonstrate upstairs make bye bye butterfly
sound transistor work intently tube tube oscillator sound tube oscillator different sound transistor oscillator frequency response buchla synthesizer couldnset oscillator example think cut maybe maybe remember now exactly range time oscillator work little hard time transition work classic electronic music studio new modular synthesizer certainly san francisco tape music center move mill college teach mill way do master time

involve maybe famous piece ever make san francisco tape music center premiere c play piano right

play piece

course play

yes play

another popular piece time

c still much play many place yes

silver apple moon popular piece time also broad pop culture right

yes

lead pop musician rock musician time come san francisco tape music center want collaborate

come collaborate us learn electronic music anthony martin picture visual artist begin rock show fillmore auditorium san francisco late new york fillmore rock band light show see today seed san francisco tape music center

though study classical music environment people react san francisco tape music center group

werenexactly interest people gradually change move tape center mill important contract rockefeller foundation want us responsible fiscal agent mill us crazy artist

crazy artist

still

true

maybe crazy know

pick name san francisco tape music center ever debate call music debate term music

course isnmusic make piece toronto utms call music gertrude stein piece phrase music loop play finally disintegrate

piece listen late piece actually extract performance tune meditation kitchen new york

okay right
music tune meditation live

find specifically interest piece liken human body computer system text interview say give human code solve problem case give code

right

desire result make sound

algorithm actually

give people algorithm become instrument

yes right build instrument

music make without human understand instrument always include human
pauline oliveors
yes human inventive creative happen wouldn able write

mention term expand instrument system early human piece hear already count expand instrument system technology

expand instrument system delay time require equipment yes early day expand instrument system lug around couple tape recorder heavy duty experience set do studio now carry tape machine think couple sony triple recorder exactly lightweight carry around weren heavy ampex machine big studio machine interest need truck load train load equipment first instance try make electronic music year come fact phone now must remind mixer san francisco tape music center mixer mill either do variety way figure

say mixer san francisco tape music center now people phone surprise fast go exactly imagine future

imagine happen predictive

say eis expand instrument system always delay
pauline oliveors
yes

specifically delay fascinate

accordion player play sound little possibility bend play sound delay sound return bend foot pedal send voltage control delay sound quite pedaler control pitch foot come back delay important couldnbend original sound certainly bend 2 sound 3 4 whatever

reverb play important role though work especially think day actually hometown cologne late deep cistern play

right yes 2 reverb delay underground cathedral water supply cologne yes whole project forget name person instigate cologne else invite cistern also close time stuart dempster panaiotis go cistern fort ward washington state climb foot ladder cistern pillar make reinforce concrete 2 reverb time make cd call deep listen

listen bite stuart dempster panaiotis
music pauline oliveors stuart dempster panaiotis lear

thank thank

release think

yes release new albion record make record go cistern

call deep listen namesake

practice

practice develop now many year actually together partner sit

ione yes

ione maybe have introduce practice us

yes first say decide release name album come deep listen laugh roll floor foot underground deep listen come pun pun good lead

agree

happen start name different program deep listen first deep listen retreat sangre de cristo mountain new mexico small retreat center happen besides generator electricity electricity generation water rain rain water peaceful wonderful place start practice say deep listen retreat
next say eight year learn lead facilitate rather facilitation leadership hierarchical facilitation collaborative people ione sit right practice listen dream part deep listen facilitate call dream community people start dream together often experience dream relational create interest community analyze dream creativity come happen dream part deep listen practice part heloise gold heloise movement practitioner tai chi creative movement part also listen body important practice
recently experience tell illuminate deep listen whole year now work tarek atoui improviser composer commission instrument build hard hear deaf teach rensselaer polytechnic institute tarek residence artist experimental medium perform art center need interact student seminar call new instrumentation performance student eight work project build instrument interface hard hear deaf interest project take bite think experiment
end semester concert studentprojects another concert may instrument tarek commission next time work together bergen norway last august past august first time work project actually deaf people three first day residency interview robert demeter facebook demeter robert robert demeters anyways robert beautiful interest vibrant communicate halfway decide decision make ask robert conduct piece call sensational sound hear nonhearing performer
arrive bergen title decision ask robert conduct piece first compositional decision right two woman deaf also talk musician use piece norwegian philharmonic dozen musician ask three deaf performer teach musician perceive instrument play tell musician leave instrument home another compositional decision instrument perform instrument tarek commission
beautiful see engage right away nonhearing hear performer relationship turn around deaf teach hear end even twohour time musician improvise instrument sound pretty good next day give first section piece ione contribute take dream process creative aspect dream preside first section piece call eaglenest dream name performer performer kind interest dream name fit section eaglenest ins out
roberttask conductor bring people take simplistic happen start improvisation quite obvious robert amplification device perceive music okay clear conduct give musician expressiveness expressiveness come understand gesture feel sense level probably whole body music extraordinarily important way robert conduct whole piece minute audience sell people venue former sentralbadet municipal swim pool instrument set deep end pool appropriate right

without water

without water right imagine water want

good moment open question pauline actually talk experience radical quietness

question sure microphone somewhere otherwise win able hear hard hear hard listen

long microphone around

good

hello thank inspire performance last night lecture meditation question session right

whatever say ask sing

comment dance whatever

question throw first relate meditation session realize use power silence music also way form concept last night realize rhythm actually lie silence pad play find interest also realize use intentional sound address sound make purpose emphasize sound make purpose ask perceive role silence creative pattern have thought

practice call deep listen time always listen around mind perform generate first sound happen listen listen maybe listen exclusively maybe listen everything hear incorporate perform
example interest time vancouver canada play beautiful wooden structure play solo accordion vaccordion accordion life somewhere probably minute performance fire engine go performance three people come say fire engine go time answer listen hear become part piece call paulineorchestration

another question besides use silence develop analog use technology talk maxmsp last night use midi laptop together instrument take role technology make music prefer another perceive say somebody program think self still concept still analog have use technology help make way perceive

use word technology mean computer right

development

okay analog native hear awhile back start transition expand instrumentation maxmsp analog become computerize eis system now almost completely maxmsp program however always analog end get signal speaker speaker analog replace speaker future sure materialize sound computer have pretty interest project somebody somebodies try nice materialize person place another fly plane okay right answer question

definitely

hello

hello

thank much everything follow question hybridization extend instrument system sound fascinate have maybe detail improvise strictly maxmsp program interact

yes course do datum design way programmer help make possible course always ask impossible keep develop evolution system since say now ask ask

specifically wonder perform interact system totally clear work speak

totally clear either necessarily interest listen come back interact perform tell expand instrument system algorithmic change play sound necessarily happen may come back modify change pitch change modulation act sound bend various way whatever play expand mean extend expand play present listen sound come back future listen back past expansion time consider time machine every sound come speaker sound make point performance sound process algorithmically system expand instrument system

beautiful clear explanation way thank open source share wide community exclusively use

maxmsp right now open source code maxmsp max work within program work max right now possible though

perfect thank

follow question regard say hybridization system consider technology part way consider cyborg make music

cyborg huh yes course cyborg replacement lens eye example couple tooth mean way

say play technology part

yes feel feel intimately connect happen yes

mention facebook presence someone work early deep listen happen social medium find surprise feel contradictory deep listen practice spread noisy environment

mean listen

listen world wide web

listen noise listen noise somebody else okay hello

hello thank much lecture question guess aware call schumannresonance idea tone tone proportional earth bass tone earth produce musical think build world vibration music exist

exactly

relation proportion earth human body think may frequency suitable geometric proportion surround frequency time low high telecommunication also new meditation start oscillate meditation go high think suitable range frequency human body special information music

think learn quite bite hang deaf community hear ear mean hear whole body obvious interest robert conduct piece conduct gesture appropriate instigate different rhythmic pattern perceive also queue people musical way
deep listen deaf community inform always like around deaf community even though havenlearned sign still feel important term expressivity presence interchange another think find interest information

good advice thank

welcome

okay will ask anyway first hanna mention facebook instructionary instruction wouldn fit facilitator whatever deep listen technique follow idea dream community talk

yes sure example kathy kennedy life montréal kathy say come

online

online yes anyway kathy kennedy call deep listen certificate entitle teach deep listen workshop person communication find online kathy kennedy

interest

video youtube watch pauline teach go deeplisteningorg believe see think question matias

want

let ione speak first
ione
add deep listen program teach happen online happen center deep listen rensselaer people actually study certificate deep listen totally online program special innovative wonderful

yes sure

thank much information will add another question go little bite back ask maybe formulate another way listen insightful lecture fascination instance radio sound shortwave much understand real reverbs physical approach also say physicality way imprint tape find analog mechanical physical way
wonder oppose physical approach create explore sound nowadays somehow facilitate obviously technique simulate simulate delay simulate somehow provoke create via tape technique happen simulate way seem happen
see physical process sure different simulation see also change quality environment follow obviously nobody us many us access either system swim pool studio full tube oscillator obviously place allow us experience therefore go accessibility program available everyone want listen reflection

yes course yes pretty much different think example commercial instrument available now may shortchange term frequency response simulation may take short cut simulation resemble completely analog version get good think get good term term technology computer programmer listen
teach probably engineer now deep listen class rensselaer polytechnic institute think quite change participate learn actually improvise compose perform end semester student produce two recording mix edit make piece maybe threeminutes piece never experience respect
come listen listen work tool adequate express express important think choose carefully think now choice enormous actually especially cruise around internet talk people world think absolutely fabulous also comment impress create special place work interact another
interaction probably important interaction loren rush stewart dempster lifelong friend still touch sometimes stewart deep listen band year people meet variety way go along interaction say bless important

thank much

question leave leave hello want ask deep listen meditation encourage inclusive listen inside outside happen far place different dimension
think possible express transition make music somehow reduce listen melodic line certain constraint within listen inclusive listen experience meditation way reconcile think possible express feel deep listen inclusive listen music sound strive music particularly enjoy listen attempt

okay sit perform listen listen everything try open whole field whatever involve time people come want fire engine go time okay
studio work analog come work analog studio important part listen studio instrument adapt intention purpose purpose intention come listen always primary say make plan follow say improvisation follow plan always fail couldnquite good plan anything go listen answer answer want

addition personally practice find gesture immediate response listen practice rather sound next phase first gesture sound come afterwards

mmhmm

find work body movement important part

important listen though body sort formalistic practice tai chi chi gung yoga example good practice keep also creative movement important move freely find body spontaneity spontaneity movement think important part practice

thank

hello thank much lecture concert yesterday work

thank

maybe question obvious hear thought important deep listen important

may important start pun right

pun important

happen course produce less maybe deep listen certificate holder call go program now qualify teach workshop produce quite online course deep listen certification run tomie hahn director center deep listen rensselaer program open available new one start january oneyear course meet sunday eastern time month instructor first time instructor deep listen certificate holder come along us
ione heloise will visit class give input twice whatever begin send certificate holder carry many workshop different part world now carry deep listen forward inquiry recognition seem help way hope way

thank everything wonderful lecture question relate engineer speak early teach engineer programmer help system use perform also career decade
eet lab collaboration also engineer wonder right now many tool available produce mainly engineer quite integral new practice artistic practice describe interaction engineer prescriptive exactly collaborative idea interaction expand system performance come understand criterion objective engineer

okay deep listen class everybody participate first call energy exercise energy exercise go whole body activate lymph flow blood flow electrical flow begin understand nerve ending palm hand actually feel electrical impulse feel begin
also nerve ending sole foot sense call three different energy heat feel heat foot foot may cold expression cold foot feel pull gravity feel else forget heat electricity nerve ending sole foot energy exercise help people recognize different kind signal body happen weekly practice come exercise engineer begin use exercise
recommend people sit front computer day call arm swing swing arm forward back release tension arm us aware much tension hold arm part teach aspect
next listen meditation do different focus give listen meditation listen meditation period journaling student write experience exercise break break mean fourhour seminar take care first two hour 2 two hour always workshop instance ask people bring find object class make sound find make kind sound hear across room
bring find object listen personobject small group say four five people work together minute everybody demonstrate improvisation find sound next project probably record find sound make piece keep finally end semester produce two recording piece do improvisation do composition compose find object record piece experience listen different way okay work engineer
now listen assignment every week read book call audio culture good information different composer practitioner various kind nice discography bibliography student ask listen three piece write three sentence piece threesentence review end semester student write final paper base journal base listen whatever choose subject
now engineer often ask listen noise piece fun say guy go machine shop make record say sound new york city compose say guy guy engineer one rise noise level new york city place high say deep listen

thank

hello hello thank question spirituality



spirituality

oh okay

always part intuition inclination towards spiritual path also musician deep make music try understand relationship music spirituality become little clear start droneoriented music tonal listen long tone slow change filter wonder experience practice music form spiritual path relationship music important

listen spiritual path listen learn able put someone elseposition part spirituality thank

say pleasure listen listen thank much come

thank
