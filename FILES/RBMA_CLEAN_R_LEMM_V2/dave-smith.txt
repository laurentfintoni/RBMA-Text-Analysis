good spirit gentleman sit next will actually help us try figure noise come know little bite noise therefore
ask join welcome mr


thank

early mr tomita ask whether ever meet wendywalter carlos
walterwendy carlos wonder actually remember
album come

switch bach snowflake dance

switch bach yes

initially interest electronic
music synthesizer

shape form

interest hear electronic sound lifelike
way play sound acoustic instrument electronic life amaze hear way play

record actually hear radio
contact

buy album doubt play radio
probably remember

never mean

right bestselling classical album time
may still recordever break s
pretty amaze synthesizer beat big orchestra

may bias

may

time

year come late remember probably still college even remember year come anybody probably still college

college

uc berkeley electrical engineer computer science
play band side play guitar bass
guitar

berkeley anything close imagine

somewhat regularly pretty crazy

crazy form

tact squad come street tear gas whatever
silly time also pretty interest period live


protester

protester observer watch actively involve

mean think talk music
electronic time interest close actually
overlap actual current affair friend live build guy find watergate document example bizarre little overlap think hey hollywood scriptwriter wouldn think

crazy time recognize necessarily

study

electrical engineer computer science

look mean mildly different

everybodyprobably tire hear use
young computer huge write program punch card
turn computer center wait hour
back see compile slow process
probably still write
program compose music way
print plotter draw five line draw circle put asterisk middle quarter note pretty rudimentary way back basic

machine process

roomsized computer control datum
computer think long go

remember dad computer book time little late actually
photo someone extremely proud
tictactoe draw onto screen day machine will
able play tictactoe

remember senior year professor predict day
power computer cost course
everybody way couldn course
fraction power iphone day

still care magnitude law datum storage
process power go actually

take advantage whatever technology available re
design new product usually think detail
say need part memory basic
back processor memory
input output make computer course
instrument less many computer

opinion much actually need
use efficiently

hopefully zero job right nothing
computer make music

way approach first start implement
circuitry order generate music

start make instrument use first product
actually analog sequencer buy
minimoog play around decide build go build decide try sell always userpoint view engineerpoint view

much minimoog back



money car time right

yes

pretty good car actually

good car car

pretty good bad

buy new car amount

university time right

yes work aerospace industry time nobody
want hire engineer become silicon valley
quite silicon valley yet early technical
revolution suppose may say work lockheed stupid
work place job friend tell
see synthesizer music store say oh sound
interest go look minimoog
idea work look cool
perfect combination music background technical background
next day go lockheed credit union loan go back
buy


guess another may need thank military
industrial complex

indirectly

mean machinery look similar find
actual lockheed product right

maybe suppose back basic make parallel

buy minimoog probably similar experience mr tomita early describe even deal modulars still little bite painful anyone every buy era room anyone ever try
era room guess first moment similar everyone
actually make sound good
master

trial error couldn hop internet find
work play around doubt
book think even manual come minimoog
slowly figure work people
never figure famous story hear way back
english friend mine go pink floydstudio
see minimoog cover duct tape ask
instrument cover tape apparently
somebody find sound like have roadie come
tape knob have always sound
early programmability guess

take live environment mean
band decide play encore have need roadie wheel next

doubt live use minimoog live pretty much
unless use sound turn
cutoff

much see machine actually relate
learn school already waveform

virtually nothing take computer class take
basic electronic class absolutely nothing
learn oscillator filter forth

deliberate decision start build first unit go
sequencer

mostly want play read
book even find moog make big
sequencer everybody analog sequencer assume
row knob send control voltage synthesizer
control pitch filter whatever

probably first hurdle lose people control voltage

depend far back go many synth expert
ooh okay work many people
way around synth okay good far
mumbojumbo

mumbojumbo actually good good chance
people sleep physic class stage
start figure oh hang actually help
give us cliff note version think
people may helpful

actually relevant now say basic subtract
synthesis analog synthesizer pretty much pass
test time now around good year still use
every day use analog form use form access
virus nord software synthesis implement
subtract synthesis since revival analog lately
real back basically start oscillator
harmonically rich different shape different tone color
pass filter everybody know filter
take pretty much basic concept start
sound filter use envelope
basically control shape change sound
whatever reason happen synthesis method easy understand relate mean sure happen
turn cutoff knob filter sound everybodyheard
everybody relate synthesizer knob s
classic sound now think
around long time compare fm synthesis
nobody figure program wouldn clue s
subtract synthesis accessible

perfect patch
probably nifty setup use machine
will little bite probably demonstrate re
talk

sure nice
prophet simple
every control front panel instrument now
go different page many feature
forth actually make whole front panel life
let go real simple sound musical tone okay
simple get single sawtooth musical tone

sorry see early camera
impression signal bad musical
tone

hold note



hold note now go cutoff musical tone
everybody know sound usually little bite resonance musical tone basic sound analog synth course add 2 oscillator musical tone beef little mostly matter modulate change sound real time add
lfo change

lfo

okay lfo get basic class okay
learn year worth synthesis class five minute

main oscillator sawtooth listen audio
frequency hear pitch low frequency
oscillator hear pitch may change
twice 2 basic shape lowfrequency
oscillator musical tone hear change frequency s
modulate pitch main oscillator hard without
blackboard describe otherwise use low
frequency oscillator change frequency main audio oscillator

try handwaves instead blackboard

hand wave lowfrequency oscillator use usually
use vibrato modulation wheel hook way
synths easy way sort articulation sound
control play live

much first start think process
follow people think oh
today introduce waveform
certain set feel oh machine need

talk specifically design product little
familiar minimoog look front panel
prophet see similarity
start minimoog back minimoog arp odyssey two big instrument day since minimoog look
minimoog whereas have get arp odyssey maybe look
arp odyssey basic always sawtooth wave
always pulse wave often triangle wave always lowpass filter given beyond different prophet first polyphonic synthesizer

monophonicpolyphonic

buzz word funny minimoog first come since
keyboard people go first
have play chord note play have go
break concept people see keyboard piano organ play chord argument say trumpet play note wheel
different control minimoog actually articulate much
single note monophonic monophonic mean note
place note time benefit
original use minimoog usually play lead line
solo bass line often people able play note time play bunch note call polyphonic voice multiple voice prophet actually first polyphonic programmable synthesizer come

late dr record early sort role model less product say god want us
voice give us hear
need form choir mean good business need sell synths way play chord now yes may help polyphonic synth

definitely everybody always want even now
monophonic synths
fun play actual play
polyphonic unit

even though time people try
push boundary say now keyboard limit
us actually create new instrument start think
old term pretty close right

always argument fact look back synthesizer
history original synthesizer actually invent two people
time east coast west coast actually berkeley main reason wellknown put keyboard synthesizer different type controller reason
limit call blackwhites
everything play note note
also first invent sequencer invent synthesizer think even say may build modular synth people realize

mean moog marketable name

flashy name minimoog come
keyboard portable reasonable cost fairly available mean wereneverywhere people think million minimoogs think build world musical instrument huge numb

still moog modulars

right definitely

buchla system

definitely

educate guess many unit sell

idea

mean definitely little four digit guess

think

actually hear people machine
actual people behind build

hear probably meet bob late
probably little late meet alan pearlman another
person found arp alan r pearlman name arp
come guy run company course tom
oberheim roger linn rest gang

consider shape form competitor

shape form

box bout filterbetter

actually friend have always together trade show
animosity place fun
back course easy innovate
none do every year fun see
people come new everybody know everybody
along

trade show mildly different mean namm basement
hotel right

show prophet january namm show many
namm show many people namm show okay s
big trade show musical instrument world
actually funny story first show basement
disneyland hotel big january namm show back
summer namm show chicago huge
instrument market piano organ brass instrument band
instrument company base midwest
huge show start tiny shoot los
angeles anaheim next year technology take
become west coast industry january show
big big big eventually summer show go away
disappear year recently bring back
small show nashville summer guitaroriented
show make sense real interest see whole
music industry move west technology take

curious say early valley
much silicon around profit way
company cluster

sure everything intel hightech
company close definitely help

go say okay love machine
guess obviously go internet go oh
curtis chip
actually go certainly silicon
mold etch

two part lead development prophet
already background microprocessor know work
day job use microprocessor real obvious
use microprocessor make programmable polyphonic synth
know people e system probably
across town hear involve develop new chip set oscillator integrate circuit filter circuit envelope vca say oh obvious take part put together
microprocessor build polyphonic programmable synth know
two lead
first even start
design figure obvious idea moog arp
already wait month figure maybe
hadnheard anything decide
sort jump

pretty crucial step guess go way
people try decide whether pursue career
music start business wow put
behind

take risk point mean start sequential circuit night weekend regular day job
work engineer wait point hit
critical mass jump quit job
say go

big company actually grow

sequential circuit peak people maybe

also administer

headache

actually people help side someone else

little hard
kid work way
control great time time
also difficult competition keep get ratchet
every year fortunately couple year first come
much competition start
crowd

crowd look back now guess
new company do
differently age

circumstance different now unfair comparison company now instrument completely different tiny company us think design tool
much efficient now much
software guy hardware guy
three us pretty much design product fast
quick big company small market
department sale department people tell us
whatever make us much efficient couldn do way back

obviously now easily source letsay motherboards
etch customize chip

main reason many people back build
unit silicon valley real factory
time around contract manufacture though build
across town instrument still build san francisco
export advantage local production
build china headache
factory big difference

speak factory market get crowd stage japan
enter game remember first visit

remember first visit probably time mostly
year back first visit year whatever reason
sure big gap fun come back
see change remember trip
first probably around maybe

reason

visit japanese distributor

learn company roland

already know mean obviously everybody sell
instrument go trade show meet people
company already yamaha roland korg
sell s

company guess fundamentally different whereas look lineage yamaha come company compare roland example explain little bite

big difference yamaha yearold company
whatever everything build piano have
build motorcycle build sailboat bathroom kind
classic big company dx think have sell
maybe sell never quite understand
direction want
roland completely different roland find ikutaro kakehashisan engineer sharp guy first x amount year roland completely drive productdriven company
central person vision difference
huge company top big difference
two company

fascinate probably motivate look
history guy company
lifetime way read letsay quincy jones
biography go bankrupt three time mean look now
maybe rather german way approach germany ever
fail may commit suicide do
guy go oh okay letstart another

glad german

change name guess someone lineage mean kakehashisan different company beforehand right

hammond japan ace tone structure
exact company

guy good right

see last week visit hamamatsu

still trick hear

roland split start
another company

age

exact age less think

bite entrepreneurial research spirit

yes

talk circuitry

little bite everything hadnactually meet probably
grammys together wasnable come la
ceremony chance meet actually
reason come stop visit
fun catch

mean guy work together also know midieval
early

long story hear

guess folk settle

nighttime story start guess happen
prophet first musical instrument microprocessor
soon company start make instrument microprocessor
microprocessor instrument realize easy
communicate digitally another instrument microprocessor
accessory polyphonic sequencer remote keyboard numb
special interface develop
purpose actually serial interface ten time fast
midi roland call dcb bus oberheim another bus
yamaha everybody different course product
different company connect us sort
figure dumb industry go
someplace fix point industry still
pretty small synthesizer decide somewhat aggressive
deliver paper aes convention new york october

aes

audio engineer society technical organization audio engineer
present paper call usi universal
synthesizer interface basically call arm say
need interface actually fully define
interface say start point doesn
follow meet january
anaheim namm show invite anybody make keyboard
come meet think wellattended
say usi perfect
doesn want involve become clear
quickly people people want high speed parallel
bus people want wait see people
invent syndrome idea

invent syndrome

nih standard engineer term nih mean bad idea
idea somebody else s

invent forget little discourage meet happen roland people approach next day say us still go booth meet roland korg yamaha kawai will together say okay letstart work

crazy japanese company

interest time basically start
start work throughout remember meet
get close do towards end year may
around october kakehashi come visit us sequential
finalize spec suggest
change name instead usi universal musical instrument interface
shouldn synthesizer make sense think cool pronounce umii mean
synthesizer connect sort think
little bite quite idea meet
throw musical instrument interface everybody go okay name come

military come general midi

much late nothing leave

leave people actually experience
try use midi make machine talk god
forbid 3 enter laymanterm way
explain solve midi problem quickly

depend basic idea midi basic interface
simple plug play note will
work usually midi problem come try map controller
synchronize clock sort usually
simple make sure setting right use right clock
sort midi problem mean different
different people
general midi survive year version cheap implement fairly easy implement developer important fairly simple still cover people need people way people
talk midi forth significantly
complicate use everything
nice unnecessary people actually fairly
simple system use imagine hard

guess sort technique help determine
actual problem lie find quick standard
procedure check standard talk b
talk much keep hear without anything

basic anything audio make sure cable plug
right place work audio much midi
do everythingset doesnwork oh
plug big university everything set
wonwork lack midi cable plug
audio cable plug start point
suppose make sure actually instead
way around mean talk forever

mean still go forever even extremely accomplish remember situation mr linn mr oberheim two rather season producer stand around think tempest another module hour sound



palm spring

palm spring

take think good relief everyone
room okay guy figure time
chill


probably miss cable

good chance use midi numb
reason actually intend first place


clock original spec picture
computer control even though computer pretty basic
back know future
use big problem people always
complain midi slow initially problem wasn t
midi slow instrument slow us
guilty put microprocessor instrument ask
microprocessor way much try keep
cost use cheap microprocessor back
expensive microprocessor busy midi note come
say take long time actually play wasn
problem slow midi problem microprocessor
couldn quickly play note quickly enough nowadays speed
isn issue almost always usb transmission
speed problem

interest look philosophically musical sense actually able disconnect various sound source actual play device guess open realm possibility intend degree

remember call local control
turn surface instrument
work midi remember may first spec remember year ago man come


sometimes hard enough remember last
night



start think oh hang actually allow
separate unit probably sell part rackmount version
without keyboard cost guess keyboard
controller relatively complicate develop depend amount
expression give pianist extremely manifest
hammer mechanic whatever
touch instead simple wonder start factor

far module versus keyboard think come late back
people still like stack keyboard onstage even
connect midi look good think look
good pile remember think
midi module sequential wasn late everything
pretty much still keyboard mechanic keyboard
complicate mechanically electrical partusually pretty simple
prophet velocity touch
basic come ever since obviously
everything

start introduce product

actually instrument go way overboard
prophett actually wood key long
sense velocity fly hammer have hit key
actually hit hammer move little optical sensor
sense velocity actually polyphonic touch pretty rare note key take extreme people still prophett people still think good keyboard ever feel fact start sell synclavier want good keyboard find feel good enough
put keyboard also pain ass wood take us six seven hour unit actually regulate keyboard almost regulate piano keyboard wasn plastic metal wood

realize run actual company siren build holy shit develop actually take work actually facilitate

never find part gig deal whatever come always predict everything

favorite product era within house

prophet first always first child beyond
pick favorite child say
good good musical instrument
flavor even now prophet
also prophet polyphonic synthesizer
sound different people sound prophet good
people sound prophet good
guitar player pick whether play strat les paul telecaster whichever feel right go try make keyboard give connection
musician personality character goal

much actually talk musician figure

talk musician usually fact come
product welcome feedback go ask feedback
develop distract
year now pretty good idea
new instrument doesnmean come perfect
reason develop product fast ask
feedback another see happen company see new product come tell design committee lose focus look somebody want idea push hard somebody else want idea two idea mix correctly design musical instrument think pretty clear focus tricky
mean easy few people involve easy

hold aim product obviously
classicallytrained musician jazz musician virtuoso tip
brian
eno world
probably much manual possible

people swear never read manual people say erase
every preset first instrument start scratch mean
little bite everything actually good point
anything mind say okay machine
dubstep good nobody buy mean t
target instrument particular musical genre style build
think good instrument let
market decide sometimes come
fashionable time five year late become fashionable
ten year late year late
never
come prophetvs nobody want initially stop build year late
everybody want still high demand now
classic example come nobody want
around go away course people kill now werenfashionable time us build drum machine roger linn invent drum machine samplebased everybody want sound real great sound
roland product come everybody laugh say doesnsound anything anybody nobody buy somebody realize late oh wait personality different music
always

say fashionable turn quite product around
day almost season feel approach
fashion designer way oh need ready

yearmodel actually try make huge jump instrument look line synths see common use try innovate new nobody else try catch rut build
silly try make fashion statement
try make think sound good think
people may go

decide enough knob box

hard part design funny
people company young
learn last couple year hard
teach leave perfect system come
feature idea say answeralways
yes course great idea put product nobody figure nobody use see ad soft synths say take year learn everything product spend year learn use product use now keep
simple art decide feature keep
powerful enough simple enough wrap head
around quickly

still monophonic three time numb
knob favorite

year late day
limitation still try shoot
knobperfunction interface feature knob switch
grab dive menu menudiving
nothing anybody want deal try make music s
stop software synthesizer whole seem
silly

heavily involve software synthesis long time probably
people pioneer status field enough obviously
everyone always associate anything prophetrelated tell us
little bite venture solely software base

president company call seer system mid
go threestep first build probably worldfirst
commercial software synthesizer contract intel
whole 2 generation advance
pentiumcame computer fast actually
pretty cool mostly general midi synth little bite extra
bell whistle license creative lab sell
million sound card computer
slightly fast develop call reality first
professional software synthesizer maybe
pretty cool subtract synthesis fm sample
physical model software package
fairly interest back learn year sometimes bad early market late market manufacturer go first namm show reality people walk say software synthesizer oh have play note say new
product software synthesizer
software run computer mean concept
completely foreign people take couple year
think probably native instrument first come
pro people finally start realize software synthesizer

ever offer part game

nothing stephan schmitt admit idea see seer system happen

think cosmic balance look moog
try look someone
else give take

call polymoog maybe
actually use name exactly knob minimoog
maybe think difference build versus copy

ever consider legal action

nah dislike deal legality patent fact new
company make pledge year ago start see far without use lawyer yet still use
far good

unite state america

believe

pretty impressive time though mean guy wasn people place definitely youth side mean us holy fuck half year rentworth machine know someone cd writer guess

mean good software synths cheap free say box nice everything laptop sound good sound good sound good reason use
case epiphany day realize
reason never play reality product start ask
play always play instrument
realize type type type click click drag
drag click clack play note click click drag
look feel musical instrument seem wrong say
first person make software synthesizer first person
stop make software synthesizer decide go back hardware now
see happen elsewhere see software company arturia
make analog synthesizer make software synthesizer
tell us sound analog
sound analog need build

guess also make sense pure capitalist reason
mean physical box still sell

have say hardware ultimate dongle


say play player glad picture actually
congratulation
archive slideshow video screen

must



sunnyvale first office probably four meter
four meter

love moog poster background fan
rock band

wall

right letquickly switch look

early prophet day probably slightly big
factory think probably two three thousand
square foot

little late

last year current line go buy please

drum machine people ask
update come firmware include man leave

year think another come probably within month

still involve write actual code

product guy work new product work always

right secret anything tell

sorry

goodlooking gentleman

good picture kakehashi
namm show la

happen la stay la now tell us

actually interest guy rene italy every year come namm call pasta rene go somebodyhouse maybe us dinner have put together make food sit eat drink party roger linn
usually sometimes artist show
informal

let guess play guitar

musical instrument have do namm anybody
guy namm first hour
ear start bleed leave namm even last
hear music cure temporarily unfortunately

favorite bob moog story tell people half
bottle tequila

favorite story
relate ask minimoog sound good have
go funny designer instrument
say need oscillator need filter
put part together never package
sound completely do mean idea hope
sound good always last magic part put
whole together always explain sound good
hard guitar string sound good interest way
look design musical instrument

far design go people roger kakehashisan mainly come
rhythmical instrument come soundtimbre fabric
find result different way engineer machine

funny couple first first product sequencer synthesizer actually start rhythmical instrument roger linn actually guitar player build drum machine story unreliable drummer
idea confuse people start actually record
record come linndrum
base take surprise think people actually use
way take mechanical sound make music
intend purpose

still love say rap hiphop giant quotation mark around word

think father hiphop mpcs
hilarious know roger

wow people now

actually cool picture take stanford university may good single photo cool people start leave john chowning basically invent fm
synthesis stanford university call father
dx forth

yamaha buy house

think probably take care pretty stanford university certainly make money license technology even though ask john say yamaha hard work wouldnbecome instrument without hard work come idea modest

ever ask whether chance make easy
take three people program dx right

loop yamaha instrument
designer mention early yamaha idea
take right combination
cheap instrument velocity new
voice big analog instrument
still six eight voice sound fender rhodes
people buy weigh whole little
fender rhodes back people still take rhodes tour
weigh couple hundred pound midi
early midi instrument

light
c

yes c also see leave
roger linn right next two
old gentleman middle actually leon theremin next max matthews father computer music
computer music bell lab great combination influential people world synthesis

two

think paul lasky composer david wessel earcam
long time now run symnet electronic music uc
berkeley





good suit though

everybody forget people also

think tell middle school write name picture five year wonremember oh wow

picture three four day ago actually stop
visit kakehashi first time together since
award last year fun visit afternoon



call model first product ever maybe

rhythmical instrument

rhythmical instrument work imagine may
look know sequencer work have build figure
people may buy start company call sequential
circuit think sell four

boom business

think throw bridge

oh care amaze sell anything spec
sheet model okay amaze first midi connection ever
namm show

look jupiter

actually play jupiter time couple roland
people somebody wear cool satin sequential circuit jacket

still lie around somewhere

yes denise home day actually wear public

xl

see everybody say oh remake
never day may start take order

still hold name right

yes actually recently back

ever tempt sequential ii

talk someday maybe particular
plan lettake vote change name company
instrument sequential circuit somebody say
okay jacket use
okay

inaudible



anything good part




start side business

prime limit line

exactly

prog rock typo prophet letterings use

come year ago remember
back anybody letraset
sheet letter different font rub
onto paper use
prophet even sequential circuit letraset font
think font now

inaudible



around corner



sell apple work

prophet roland jupiter prophet actually
first midi instrument ship december
month late roland jupiter come happen
namm show show jupiter
show prophet point informal
decide bring product booth make room
stick midi cable connect
actually work people ask press
big say mean
whole informal do midi usual way get
standard make take year year year committee
document dadada bypass basically
throw fit first connect
two instrument pretty much virtually fanfare involve


see fanfare moment oh great origin
midieval

early prophet ad

sphinx come

brain guy cool
airbrush john maddis actually still around run
couple month ago san francisco come
idea probably say want legend time
come

find wood

find wood



guess still minimoog influence original minimoogs
do wood first prophet make wood call koa
stun beautiful wood limit supply
stop use think make walnut maybe
forget switch idea analog synthesizer
organic wood warm back people have hear
doctor lawyer buy prophet live room furniture

make great heater

another early ad back day try explain people programmable synthesizer fact actually hit button completely change sound numb different instrument
today wander street shibuya walk music store prophet cost cost new store
dx basically market vintage
gear huge market vintage analog ask year
ago think people still use laugh mean
think design electronic use long
mean think nobody anything electronic
two three year old may toaster may
little old basically old electronic keep old
electronic run nontrivial whole
concept electronic instrument old think strange

pretty resourceful though

mean sound good

pro wow cool funny think mention early everybody else start make polyphonic programmable synths two three year decide hell build nonprogrammable monophonic synth turn upside try make inexpensive
look funky weird plastic use
probably try little hard make cheap sound way
sound people way sound another
completely accidental cool take
since wasnexpensive ton people buy
big uk europe general cost make available
people cool music make
example way early catch
early basically programmable modular effect
device anybody programmable effect idea buy
distortion unit mixer delay phase shifter whatever plug
rack become programmable set
different effect turn knob make sound
press button remember setting whatever reason fairly
expensive never catch back wouldn t
catch have stop move keep
probably successful cheap small oh


still smile bad

monster prophet
story first prophet actually two version
buy either prophet prophet exactly
case difference prophet twice much electronic inside play twice many voice turn reliable even little reliable probably good way putting hot sell many discontinue always seem come proper prophet build monstrosity two
keyboard polyphonic sequencer fun box huge

good fun need rearrange live room

pretty much hire two strong guy carry prophet rack version guess rack version go couple year late first sampler difference sampler back way
sample actually play back analog
filter give different sound hate
use usual word soften make rich
whatever say definitely use analog filter sample affect sound original drum machine way linndrums drum track forth turn completely always slightly different sound

button look oddly familiar

one also matrix program necessarily good interface problem happen dx point many parameter control get difficult
come usable user interface certainly much
challenge

navigate now mean modular version
10 knob

fun show actually
quick main control hit program
oscillator hit oscillator switch display
clear easy read fast even though s
technically menu system hit button hit another button
turn knob everything quickly accessible

display care sort way display
year obviously foresee mean
okay standard issue even re
work use step simple set parameter whereas need foreplan design

turn use
oled display will eventually gradually slightly
dim talk yearold instrument suppose
design last year will probably
replace year win around woncare
somebody else deal
