someone say last night mishear say
sound full physicality
make sound sound think
talk
recently modular synths modular review
london modular



try word modular sentence four time think
interest us may think people interest
modular synths world quite far away
people start
gap access information money
talk us interest
rig

write black light spiral do computer move
write flat london small basic bedroom
type set move london soon write finally
space actually gear remember exact
modular want look much fun re
right huge learn curve start london modular
shop london recommend try
lecturer see rig wonexplain
basically synthesizer putting together
component separately link together wire component
buy range oscillator traditional synthesis component right exist available modular format

gravitate towards first

first buy try build synthesizer use
computer vst synthesizer use point
stop anaconda write
native instrument massive wave table synth
particular sound cold almost fm rubbery
metallic sound module call braid similar
type wave table synthesis however cool modular
plug anything anything wonbreak control
voltage five twelve volt pass
absolutely crazy another
module confuse may see
spaghetti wire come part charm
sound experimentation fun natural
less happen computer

start buy start sell
finesse

module pretty expensive expensive hobby think
danger many option many
manufacturer much together
patch think oh make
end around circle bite end rig
synth many many bite
problem confuse make choice take away
produce sound sell oscillator concentrate
control sound particular set module
blow mind chaotic module bite daunt
actually try explain base chaos theory chaos
similar randomness quite way visualize
randomness black white fuzz break tv whereas chaotic
noise set initial condition will turn
almost random will repeat
modular environment start use chaotic signal
modulate control melody velocity synthesizer
pretty wild
write black light spiral quickly write another release free download also usb box set s
hour ten minute long make
three module haventold anyone mean
module make music set set initial condition plug computer hit record sometimes have record hour
come back ten minute recording think interest play 2 track quite melody chaos talk write melody find pretty wild
concept understand
music maze

music skip now hear randomness certain phrase repeat chord hear wasn contact guy make two particular
module call chaos brother good name
dreamboat snazzy fx mean people make
synthesizer pretty wild character convince
word sentient angel chaos make music
good mood will give music okay dude

happen idea possible
may fall take

mean think excite hear
music five year sound
different kind sound mean think s
excite now spend year learn get
bottom never use chaos control various synths
do midi interface
option use plug
bunch see come mean echo valley
literally step back let module talk think will next try experiment write melody apply chaos try meet middle go fly
angel man

want ask put
guy time maybe three four question try keep
snappy possible last want ask
say last night play think year
vintage year music wonder think good now

mean mention unsubscribed
crap now go buy record play record
buy wicked record year doesn t
seem though many city pop
pop local scene reinfluencing
feel though ever since postdubstep
postdubstep another phase phase
another phase another last solid grind
solid scene dubstep float around try
head round almost five year now give
try understand define good record go
gut work see anything now way
everyone interact online see another scene happen local
town doesn instantly blow time gestate
localize become global everyone hear
mean think continue work

maybe time blackout good tell
anyone okay microphone question

hey first thank see documentary
live inside speaker remember say
time swiss army knife genre
thought culture mesh
science behind magic dubstep relate sound track
anaconda make hear cool remix think
dubbel dutch release maybe also tribal guarachero edit
remix make remix xx
thought merge genre even s
pop music extremely local genre side world

mean think dubstep drum bass two musical touch point rule usually tempo bass need dubstep record certainly feel blank canvas
naturally lend mesh scene bass
beat

okay thank

feel notice phenomenon recently
noise artist start incorporate beat set think
although noise main ingredient techno since
begin wonder noise artist influence
beatdriven club influence different connection noise experimental music

say clueless idiot come music history be
lot lot learn identify people pete
swanson say interest less
interest aspect noise full facemelting blast white noise
angle less identify strange middle grind moment techno track noise else definitely pete swanson rate

cool

question back stretch okay
case say big thank
