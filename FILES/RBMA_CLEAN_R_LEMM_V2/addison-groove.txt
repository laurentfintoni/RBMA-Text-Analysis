techy use drum machine

think have another name horizon start make
music radically different

versatility different tempo feel need find another

think sound will develop will
develop sound rather look record
mark different phase career different name probably
lot different reason

haven around long maybe change attitude
couple year

nice restriction keep
good build name important
spread thinly keep keep
example someone modeselektor release first album

track make much see part artistry
delegate someone else take pride

enjoy enjoy make sound way sound
listen juke track produce badly sound amaze full soul vibe have say
anyone music composition far great mixdown help
able sculpt sound control way good

peril tour two people cost money expensive also dancer fee two
dancer entire night much difficult dance
chicago battle south side amaze
literally three four hour hear nothing footwork
never think oh much dance excite
dj fee dancer

remind tap dance

crazy battle need take five tenminute break session go hard

dance evolve

cool small small niche even chicago small dj chicago arenplaying footwork juke

mean small couple hundred people
participant
hundred people still predominantly black south side chicago massive segregate still

dedicate club putting juke footwork party

footwork party happen club cause young scene kid nine eight year old dance communitybased cause south side chicago hood rough keep kid street instead sell drug gang bad chicago

positive underground vibe

usually community center nightclub even sell alcohol community center park time summer see street
