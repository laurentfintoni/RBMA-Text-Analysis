music play orlando gibbon



piece orlando gibbon english composer midth century

bach

definitely century bach

special mind bio think
mention website particular influence

love harmony tend think old music different new music standard time standard harmony rhythm necessarily think sound
plaid sound
bach part modal follow tonal system
follow modal system plaid use mode
harmonic language always interest early age
always love old music problem piano time
wasnwritten piano piano time
certainly write wurlitzer

make quite point write piano first album first electronic speak album call piano piece piano seem important idea take putting context different instrument see
happen

yes good point piano beautiful instrument s
huge design impressive big image piano
image thcentury music maybe highscale salon parisian
style maybe wig think wrong image
piano appear little crazy instrument composer use big crazy
anything bach probably see early prototype wasn t
good
tend music
oldtime piano even exist contemporary music
piano long valid instrument techno example extreme
repertoire play old try new
always idea piano instrument future s
always
become century use instrument composer
bach touch interest century late
every hotshot composer pianist use piano main
source expression

obviously now hotshot composer use
baggage put upon piano especially within popular culture
come hear romantic quaint wigwearing salon

read interview say see piano percussion instrument think big break term think wonder point epiphany piano
romantic quaint sort early
immediate

want drummer happen piano home
probably strategic move mom want play drum
suppose first step piano try imitate drum sort
play cluster low register picture walk foot
keyboard eventually drum set soon do
practise go basement play drum whole
afternoon

mum make put basement

drum set though uncle

cool uncle

yes piano definitely percussion instrument mechanic
instrument mechanic actually point wurlitzer
see press key whole mechanism
end whole bunch back forth hammer hit
string control attack decay
piano changeable always
keyboard instrument emulate vibrato play sort
clavichord believe bachfavourite keyboard instrument
touch nice synthesizer press key
whatever finger late hear piano doesnreact stupid instrument term attack percussion base
cool piano create illusion many instrument create illusion string
instrument create illusion wind instrument course
instrumental keyboard sound bring
lead believe fact synthesizer study
classical music suppose nonclassical city new york classic
necessarily classical realize
synthesizer especially start inside piano fiddle
around overtone basically resonance filter
depend much press string effect
cut pedal release sustain
sort ancestral synthesizer

even though say haven normal classical upbringing
outsiderview go juilliard practise
classical cd parent typical taskmaster re
practice two three four hour day grow
crack whip speak immediately take

wasnforced anything enjoy much take realize want around know use piano way wasnsure exactly
guess confuse mother always want else study classical music free hour improvise jazz try digest real book chord change chorus go new york electronic music now explore try understand
jazz already fade jazz project drop
turntable mix board gear dip always idea combine piano sound think piano sound still evolve
else basic design piano design evolve year think always year fact japan summer yamaha go see yamaha
factory technology use fabricate piano unbelievable
new model new prototype come every year new technology new
mechanical instrument new pedal constant evolution

remember say record last album detroit
find piano like much wait many month
become available record album every piano every
guitar every whatever sound little bite different

different think big travel
instrument lucky half ton put
plane complicate detroit instrument think
great album wait year available
available time piano
bring carl craig s
studio planet e become piano auditorium week happy piano basically
foremost inspiration album sound piano

different piano see detroit

become geeky piano

let

okay fundamentally steinway
important brand two factory hamburg new york
market strictly divide wonfind hamburg steinway
us maybe current new york steinway different
design recognize edgy keyboard hamburg
round different bass register find new york
steinways much slam bass music
need say percussion instrument need bass register

record planet e need

definitely fight instrument studio synthesizer effect box good piano right away play chord sometimes re
stick bad piano go
record album

new york first time
talk discover techno early

visit new york teenager stay friend s
apartment mom upper west side walk around
play piano concerto time walk juilliard school
say cool place hang study three year
late accept

dj booth ask
process say

wish wish student guy sometimes have go
rami friend sometimes have go listen even
dance listen try understand groove listen new way
way think music still fight good
sense bad sense still separate element harmony rhythm
melody bass basically layer musical element whereas electronic
music relative sound note guess

immediately appeal
couldntell jumble together melody
harmony switch

definitely good techno track harmony
basically function rhythmic impulse doesnmatter
harmony hear else still fulfill
purpose give rhythmic pulse track
always attract opposite end spectrum
way course people john cage already predict music long note layer bass harmony
melody sound composer sound artist call lecture john cage probably year ahead way try approach music

play track rendition electronic track
three point anyone recognize piano
music andover
autechre andover tell
choose rearrange replay guess first
question say cover

say rendition extraordinary rendition

detroit techno track

unrelated choose classic

bell string life

see sometimes extreme meet
concrete situation institution target program
repertoire leave extreme completely

point classical career numb
various classical label see say
add bell tonight

pure provocation perhaps

let set agendum say
play frescobaldi last minute improvise play
bell

usually way around teacher say tell good joke
first think good joke electronically drive start finish frescobaldi think nice way discover old music new context didyesterday frescobaldi sort come piece hello
nobody monitor nobody tell stage place freedom complete artistic freedom place afraid
quite contrary space go far
problem promoter sometimes classical promoter strict idea sometimes negotiate meet halfway
also always great experience
classical audience hear example string life s
technology think audience never underestimate
sure promoter put list audience good
sometimes surprise elderly people come show
say piece play inside piano string
life composer play inside piano composer

someone classically train never think make connection
perhaps

maybe

play string life immediately go piano
end come time feel
handle piece

play inside piano already string life

time now time introduce team
agoria record
first version string life pretty soon version
album record bite late good piano good setting general

andover listen hear electronic
background album place come
play start play software instrument bring
fold

ago always try expand sound piano keyboard love people joe zawinul example watch video s

keyboardist weather report

yes actually classical keyboardist bebop pianist
cannonball adderley meet mile go way
never play little six keyboard synthesizer
piece furniture behind basically furniture sound
synthesizer keyboard bring rack
rack two meter high think fascinate
switch sound easily try build language
way combine different sound
juilliard great music
lab amaze old gear completely fall love yamaha
dx basic version
start use make track student
idea go beyond piano composition production
whether sit table write music paper
computer program think difference
difference try arrange perform live still play piano attractive way loop love play loop
issue play may notice yesterday loop real time play alive much press record
play loop
piano whole bunch piano loop play autechre tune edit
six minute play minute basically always
look good part cut edit together

must hard play loop say find quite easy

easy hard love play loop issue people aufgang example band rami play loop play free issue play bassline program record onebar
loop static actually
record even midi record bassline record whole track
record live sixminute track play six minute
track play much live loop
little rhythmic program different also
need quantize right
basslines much groovy think much appeal always fall
spot within bar move little bite machine think machine yet play bassline even though move time think beneficial track long loop play live

letplay track aufgang mention couple time already channel

sonar
music aufgang sonar

fine record store
sonar

aufgang first play correct

correct

base memory first performance

actually write first performance first piece

tell freedom drummer finally

great first version aufgang drum set
two piano electronic year aymeric guy
program guy use drum
great drummer play cassius whole bunch rap artist france
phoenix also drummer phoenix
soon use drum set first date holland four year ago energy double onstage
drum hold together play without click always play click live midi onstage aymeric drummer click follow hold together freedom drum set onstage

start obviously want project rami re
friend school guide principle behind whole


guess take us figure first album come together
three four year play together compose try find
sound add drum whole different


guess moment realize

composition tune try make
free live project first album take come
together drum large leap sound work
behind door computer
send file aymeric send new
basslines rami compose piano top record send
back maybe together complicate live three
different country see often always
intense way work
now space paris meet
occasionally record 2 album work
think different sense produce piano
play live drum play live rest pretty much lay
studio midi
think new album will much live feel hear moment sound rocky
sound drum general soon drummer get
aymeric machine also rock drummer

tell settle sometimes



hard band come classical background
negotiate

relief relief together vibe anything
happen invincible whereas alone tour
always different project alone travel alone prepare
alone concentrate alone prepare brother relief
good vibe small tour month ago nothing go wrong

collaboration anyway work have
work sometimes together lettalk carl first
go see dj meet afterwards say hello think infin√©
introduce two correct

yes alexandre year unofficially meet club holland

think alexmind story go say think
two need talk think think
happen

carl remember go rami say
guy come gig say alex precise goal know listen carlmusic time meet know heart say heart
mean play
music guess
six month late go detroit first time work
melody remix
first collaboration original piano take melody take
classical way necessarily close micing ambient micing
carl use take remix good come detroit

go detroit rerecorded piano part bass part make two remix first
start work together innerzone orchestra big
orchestra call versus evolve since

think videostill online performance paris
electronic play piano enormous orchestra
play must pretty special

work spend two month arrange orchestra conductor project week rehearsal come together day show
orchestra work electronic musician easy
also whole bunch technical need coordinate
sound play amplify play onstage monitor click track click track conductor click track dance end show onstage look
conduct great time great experience
repeat definitely
evolve project version germany year play couple show conduct orchestra
play much freely now dj set carl moritz
time orchestra come go
continuous mix music

surprise carl work

surprise great personality doesnthink
small doesnthink techno necessarily comparison
draw mile davis definitely think jazz go beyond
personality important art
also artist around
people complicate make happen first
start work classical musician adapt
language talk groove idea groove mean
talk feel doesnmake sense
write note paper

language now speak
term

learn process definitely
mediator two world conductor great job make
happen orchestra basically get orchestra musician yet another special breed classical musician
sometimes hard make happen
also love play loop
orchestra hate play loop bar write say
time upset bar beat
stop say beat already
play time go

do production word use
describe do record bachcage credit enchant

auricle

mean

mystery secret moritz work record couple time auricle last bachcage produce full mystery auricle bio come spontaneously whole bunch piano sample live piano record s
direct antagonist piano piano record
play live auricle end live piano sample
mix inside box
basically stereo file sound okay sound engineer definitely master engineer
count moritz make sound good think
definitely master job master job basically mean eqing maybe little bite compress manage feature part original process isolate several frequency whole track become make have version have track
bachcage present begin
project play music bach cage piece mine
short pleasure play yesterday student onstage moritz set mics process music together definitely hear touch bachcage auricle freedom

play bachcage hear moritz

look laptop music start stop
music landscape
piece john cage call landscape basically
mics piano use half
maybe regular mix way record
five mics go whole sidechain process box heavy
ring modulator delay course reverb phaser
basically live postproduction
record take live
moritzprocessing do 2 layer important
record first time afraid use process
tool classical production john cage necessarily classical
composer label classical label

come deutsche grammophon think important note

also go record store john cage will classical section
current use ring modulator record
classical piano album exactly previous album
music idiosynkrasi
piece play yesterday 2 album guess 3 album now return think tell
difference now play classical music
say classical quote
even mean
think use anachronistic way word classical
fairly recent year old use describe music
now year late call music even year ago
classical classical contemporary way
now difference play music composer another time
play music sound piano will always process always mostly think way evolve sound piano else relationship time rock production techno production use machine classic jazz reason

take long classical
classical industry also allow
deutsche grammophon say record breakthrough
way feel pass place

say whole electronic education come classical education guess combine two now fact difference whether play piece bach music take long think natural organic process try integrate
learn try define sound
pianist spend time work sound analogically fingertip weight elbow arm back important part piano sound mics pick
completely different send mics process box
totally different personal
suppose find sound describe good interest play call roleplaying game classical music interpret
past old way new way
use technology definitely help direction

must also big deal side moritz classical record take convince record label bring guy trust



have already do record guess carl

have compose start want together auricle though entirely sort remix project necessarily classical playlist moritz totally excite guess challenge
techno dub producer produce music bach
love completely crazy idea moritz want go say maybe light say moritz ring modulator turn turn give special flavor
happy play guy yesterday piece short
excerpt say excerpt cut original record
half minute remix lawrence
listen real quick

sure

also deutsche grammophon
music tristano introit lawrence remix

lawrence

anyone last night immediately recognize
little melodic riff find interest lawrence give
chance mix john cage piece bach piece choose
arenfascinating right

happy choose introit think piece
work progress say every original piece already version previous idea fully grasp head composer producer
obviously record effort go edit master already piece sound different different shape different structure remix people version collaboration another version think last night version
probably favourite version far think roll another half
hour still work piece still work
hello first piece play last night
composition five six year old keep try make evolve go place
way add program sequence way
people remix

track idiosynkrasia say do

think bring album



version version know
idiosynkrasia

set deadline someone give okay version
finish

guess make point bring
record music do begin music
begin life music put record
understand understand process
make music
bad sit back say hey music s
do someone want remix cool touch think begin bring record think
end medium say good record bad record s
good last good last
actually s
long process record relate previous
hint towards next basically long work
progress definitely definitive version

relate say interview six
month ago great composer find language define
language wonder feel get find
language work progress

determine whether find language
start year ago try combine sound
piano sound electronic music love love
sound piano love techno
impression still still impression find
idiosyncratic music suppose good
do
now explore idea classical repertoire
next project completely different towards future
past aesthetic still
sound research idea try develop bring
record help put milestone progress
development
way take last word be
always little surprise press say album new s
finish think way album step whatever re
music

bach cage seem unlikely bedfellow mind connection put next album

conviction old music doesn shield
contemporary music fact contemporary music plural
put juxtaposition old new continuous
way fact bachcage dj set music cage bach
first statement old music actually part language re
hear way hear late techno
production
cage bach definitely connect certain level minimalist definitely bach first great minimalist
similar way write score
basic score indication music title maybe
word two bach doesneven write word title music

connect rhythmic level use definite rhythmic
form rhythmic pattern bachmusic especially instrumental music
base dance baroque form dance now seem completely
sarabande dance sarabande idea
dance sarabande
suppose year ago people
sarabande house track dubstep whatever dance call
john cage use pattern strict piece listen landscape sound dreamy sort ambient actually rhythmic structure completely define remember exactly completely separate several section total amount beat sum previous section
crazy organization rhythm definitely comparable
bach
last less spiritual sense
abstract universal listen music bach cage
need information transport somewhere feel high
understand human
philosophize much bachcage
four letter also first name johann sebastian bach john cage
analogy

open question ask recently play
space ibiza
carl first time play club environment
grand piano

already space carl previous season repeat
play club rare grand piano fact also
close party luciano pacha vagabundos
piano complicate stage small suppose space
easy

big stage

good stage space besides dj booth
pacha complicate luciano
point dj booth crowd
meter opposite side barely see try connect music
love play club yesterday
hybrid usually either play piano recital
seat hall amplify electronic necessarily beaty dancey techno live set dancefloor
club keyboard
usually two three keyboard plus little machine computer yesterday bite hybrid concert also play beat usually
concert hall soundsystem concert hall mostly adapt
subby music go easy speaker

ideal place see people sit move chair
quite comfortable people stand maybe want
sit place feel ideal format hear

complement vital switch
play different environment think every hall ideal long
try feel vibe connect
audience whether quiet audience sit chair crazy audience
dance tomorrow complementary love go back
forth
also hybrid format interest maybe new
sensation expect fact
expect play adapt
tracklist
mind start play yesterday completely change
throughout show feel course lead
grand finale student

speak student anyone question have ask

two question first talk history
piano knowledge piano first invent wasn set tune scale time people tune piano
explore different tune system stick classic
tone system

right format since bach onward bach
distinctive tune system tune profession
right play around eventually break piano tune
much
work tuner crazy guy absolutely will
experiment tune antique tuning relationship interval specific key example
tell special tuner look play music
frescobaldi key f major minor c major think
2 start tune every modulation big event
relationship interval shock hear way

go completely different way tune quartertones
go traditional arab scale go completely crazy tune
system everythingpossible tune need tuner


thank secondly exploration electronica piano classical
music say word techno mean
interest work beat pattern piano re
say percussive instrument talk complex percussive
interest come electronic part
producer work seem stick format
interest complicate different

definitely issue love cool
four equal beat much beat
kickdrum accentuate every beat harmonically
piano pretty much syncopate much space beat
make groove happen limit anything
common denominator classical music certain figure
alberti bass show briefly
play wurlitzer
classical music hear always
always different definitely abstract beat have
work people sutekh heavy fourfloor
definitely also sound music beat piano
ambient property need beat
spacey

play drum feel last year evolution rhythm
beat culture come people play drum
common
perception among drummer electronic producer programmer have
evolve beat culture feel harmony

interest point absolutely agree think machine
drummachines also synthesizer way organic musician play
change absolutely
say specific chord progression noncomposer basically play
around find chord find interest become another language become new detroit techno example
hear pentatonic lay pretty easily s
black key example become specific sound
way listen necessarily hear pentatonic scale
hear new conglomerate pitch determine harmony
piece sure far go analogy think great harmonizer example great
harmony mad mike underground resistance gospel
jazz background
evolution linear
now move hand inch basically
circle go back forward become much rich harmonic
language become much rich rhythmic language since advent
beat machine think now amplify
field learn
think
definitely right beatboxing change
perception rhythmic structure come organic drum
count among guy say play drum
piano play drum

couple question first version landscape
record

studio berlin august

listen little even
version computer totally uncredited
blow away play even sample couple time
hope isn problem

win problem may john cage s
publisher

2 ever see move away piano completely
dive deep synthesize sound maybe even harmonic sample

definitely ultimately project combine sound
electronic acoustic realm eventually will bring
piano already bring piano many
element count piano
happy piano stage feel home laptop die midi controller
go away power whatever piano will still sound nice companion onstage will always sound matter happen bomb doesnmatter will always sound
piano sound titanic go think
definitely probably notice play piano play much
play loop always solo right hand chorus minimalistic approach guess
extreme end play piano anymore now know future

notice yesterday show quite emotional
content music quite dissonance
come interest dissonance within sort
music

interest question read lecture john cage day
say old way compose discern consonance
dissonance new way compose discern organize sound versus
noise call noise unorganized chaotic sound
whatnot
dissonance dissonant surprise everything s
dissonant long dissonant become consonant
work simple harmony simple chord major trial minor trial
sometimes 7
point break
break set marker
introduce dissonance consonant will
transform next part way see suppose spontaneous calculate come

program dissonance whatever play
piano say free play live
play hand sometimes see eq right
hand still play consonance ear speak

nowadays hear everything different hear large range
music nothing shock anymore dissonant
shock hear have go way
play please harmony play different s
shock
first piece play tonight gibbon
way start pretty soft minory sudden go
completely necessarily dissonant progression s
within tonal structure music surprise create
new context way listen music even old music
especially old music
new music shock anymore old
music difficult shock nowadays last time
shock hear think refresh listen old
piece play yesterday year old dissonant
time get think maybe wall old new
illusion

thank

anyone else question thank much francesco
