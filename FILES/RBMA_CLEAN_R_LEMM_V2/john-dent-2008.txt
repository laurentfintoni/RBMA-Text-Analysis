kick exactly master

master make choice record track mix track theory world competitive lot professional make good recording may sound weak lifeless insignificant
may seem work room studio west england sit pile gear reference monitor system tell stark black white whether hasn

hit l happen workstation approach subtle tell client plugin construct signal path equipment come wonderful music give demonstration point

master track exactly try achieve

numb factor end day someone try say
musically override everything also look type musical style genre someonefitting will people invent new style always ballpark area someonefitting real world listen music finish accept hear music may good sound good level imprint become identity music lifetime tune hear everywhere tune
master stage say necessarily case master stage say somewhere five ten percent receive approximately right somewhere close good level ideal five ten percent analog tape recording still sound client base work primarily analog use technology benefit offer quick cut paste effect use tape pj harvey track sometimes record system zero automatically sound fantastic
yardstick use large database

give dat cd reel explain process moment give get onto vinyl

vinyl cd different medium need vinyl perhaps need cd problem vinyl cut good record sometimes people actually play back record player cartridge effectively filter good cartridge good record player little filter hear record nowadays people technic turntable dj cartridge backtrack type pickup actually change sound quite dramatically may good bass change sound quite hear record
come dat first transfer onto sonic solution workstation reason listen play sound workstation bass sound much good play directly dat machine link clock system sound much good good clock extension bottom end sound little harsh start make sure every record play back good need explore need play record need see deal
first test cut usually good level nothing do observe happen quite often record need bass sound bite dull
form opinion need happen range deck six different pickup plug feel sound push see far go push start distort break hihats start break kick drum cut record kick drum groove get extreme go towards label jump

send track master stage deliver

happy mix everyone happy mix mix work may necessarily right level generally sound feel right right time send idea extra compression extra limit maybe quick
cd send record company radio quite often good idea send copy limit compress version raw uncompressed version less see difference make think work equipment use studio subtle achieve good big level without lose much nice idea without whole compress

now vinyl expert interest hear describe difference listen record listen cd

world analog record high resolution resolution think term pixel day multitrack record good desk disc cut actually cut record technically four time
resolution cd camera vinyl four megapixel cd everyone different type record player vinyl start cheap player know bite money good cartridge record player retrieve quality back
hifi whole industry design retrieve much resolution vinyl record cut pre era fantastic store sound people use sample highresolution sound format retain optional highresolution format

show us

yes zero interest come us couple year ago like concept putting music onto vinyl make cd test take away compare decide want whole album garden album via vinyl

slight diversion otherwise forget show trick hadneven realize cut sieve brain keep work work work find record cllection actually quite proud cut show little trick
music atomic dog

sound difference finish press disc cut disc cut sound good actually good bottom end record sit turntable mass microscopically vibrate listen buy
record clamp clamp record turntable give much clean big bottom end glass turntable add extra weight stop vibrate use sound remove glass see whether hear difference
music atomic dog continue
another tip find record clamp clamp record turntable sound good back resolution customer bring hendrix track want use reference play cd say weird half

subject vinyl vinyl junkie room tell proper way set technic turntable mean cartridge everything

okay issue weight stylus arm start point point balance adjust arm parallel record parallel turntable part
recommend weight different cartridge need heavy record sound bite thin scratchy right weight actually stylus balance device weigh weight stylus primary way use ear light bass heavy top end suffer area okay
deck set arm right place hifi deck ability move arm backwards forward gauge allow set side parallel important antiskate dial point side turntable studio easily pick uncut acetate place turntable put stylus shouldnskate towards center side point perfect balance difficult think
press people set turntable
look whether headshell orientate correctly whether
cartridge vertical record issue whether arm high whether tilt forward backwards technically need oscilloscope tone generally bite trial error spend time patient see find good sound

us familiar nightclub see stanton ortofons maybe shure stylus design hold groove loud look stylus listen record
home high quality recommend

stylus stanton use linear frequency response frequency record come right level quite dj cartridge bass rise midrange cut strange top nothing wrong work sound reference purpose use actually wire arrangement agree rewire cartridge actually back studio direct stanton rewire
do especially look sell product
spherical elliptical stylus
whiteboard come go whiteboard bite lesson groove sound cut system put music stylus fine edge
fine frequency response high indeed stylus play back idea everything back groove strange happen record explain take enlargement groove give high frequency
view record groove
view high frequency movement wall groove center line point bottom wall groove draw three curve parallel line sort wall have see microscope draw two

label good form music hear effect house tune big hihat ten minute long spread across record first threequarters record sound fine last bite hihats drop level general grunginess sound start increase



back board return whiteboard imagine slice cake center hole record outside edge move fast waveform outside edge spread quite large distance cut waveform center shape
squash imagine squeezebox concertina squeezebox outside edge spread arm wide inside edge push back together record player find difficult play point narrow wave point wide wave happen difference technically good speed

scratch dj love always good opinion

think keep customer happy good technically good recognize scratch certain form music avoid especially long side fortyfive work eighthalf minute beyond amount space
shrink long side tend often need compensate look top end test cut make sure close

cut need penny top headshell make sit groove draw line quest loudness clarity overdo

common sense level work tend use people rely release date expect cut press work expect tie tour whatever time
experiment level push level loud cut little record player play back problem return jungle tune find way
play weight stylus bass energy general power groove nice loud sometimes practical go far

obviously passionate vinyl sure many us apart major release actually dance culture dj culture hiphop keep vinyl culture alive hiphop dance now go see favorite dj actually play
vinyl play serato cd genre vinyl simply buy sell anymore putting tune together unless radiohead someone know afford luxury make loss incentive release vinyl day

certainly understand financial implication think creative satisfaction spend time energy work tune even small run vinyl great way get music interestingly enough vinyl still trade ebay good price good tune good tune people buy sell record ¬£ ebay lose value good tune always vinyl think resurgence interest vinyl band now sound three minute energy come record

think band view colour vinyl whatever promotional novelty oppose actual format use

necessarily see anything wrong view novelty fact produce goodsounding record novelty wear less still available record label wonspend ¬£ press record spend two grand advert last week
magazine understand priority type situation work artist whose record label wonrelease vinyl come money
certain prestige vinyl

move realm tell importance sample rate

sample near equivalent film frame film snapshot look way snapshot happen sample per 2 sample accurate sample sample basically come period year year people work

cd hear put cd

yes yes sound horrible limitation real sound maybe another picture return whiteboard take real life five sound hear room stand
front drum kit saxophone player five look analog era good microphone good mix desk decent cut
four go high resolution somewhere around three four

mean

dynamic range record system sample rate sample per 2 good analog end point five cd somewhere draw two clever amount information come great
historically go somewhere much good tune people rave old tune soul four term record
limit sample system win able four approximation encourage client work high sample rate wherever possible master cd retain high sample rate end session sample cd
way

master cd stay

master studio stay less equipment sample practical purpose file storage use outboard gear get sample stay
practical issue much gear around outboard world work

high sample rate around moment

onebit sacd mhz huge huge sample rate completely different technical system pcm pulse code modulation sacd interest invite abbey road studio listen pioneer development sony huge back catalog material much deteriorate decide invent system fast sample sample analog without worry lose anything lot test invite abbey road live band play super audio recorder halfinch tape machine invite compare listen two system sound
sony refine use system archive material right back metalwork engineer around globe archive vast amount material store form
product super audio cd put hasn take much sony perhaps think nevertheless alternative option pyramix audio workstation record sacd

work audio already bite point end session ask bounce bite

good question actually find room equipment set bite sound system bite careful throw dither noise record change tonality sound much dither add change sound keep system bite dither automatically

general rule always work high sample rate use bite

yes work k master last couple year much pleasurable experience hear detail energy good engineer session recently someone italy revert back work surprise
much start remind come

point master loud possible

studio call loud call loud enough

lead question talk call
loudness war new metallica album s

think arctic monkey loudness always work mot√∂rhead mot√∂rhead loud look way engineer produce material have put tape needle vu go plus actually stay wouldnmove level limit compression almost line tape machine use mot√∂rhead tape much loudness think loudness subjective loudness isn hammer limiter wellrecorded piece information sound loud without necessarily loud
try offer client scale someone bring record sound quiet look
meter listen comparison say oi carl cd eight db quiet need think ask bump realm far bump look music aim track full pelt need maximum volume point make entire track level look far push take away actual design track first place will always use
analogue gear first preference gear much much good sound compression sound natural
comparison dr mika think compression do analog tend give big wide fat version start clip unlistenable people approach will literally hit limiter hard everything mash

hear people say tune mix case much percent master

tricky recording little think master make quite big difference vibe vibe record track sometimes bite lose sometimes vinyl cd master nudge vibe back sound sometimes bite strange sometimes choose signal path analog limiter sound certain way put
hiphop automatically sound way sound authentic big wide bite rough correctly master will enhance end day people hear
go buy master record think master take anything away people contribute enormous amount year ago goldfrappfirst album will alison come pile dats idea want say start bite compression say compression say let prepare everything master everything give take away
say wow fantastic leave hardly change anything influence approach project hadnseen begin master help record grind put

actually mystery magic involve mix record give magic

think

say listen make sound hundred time
strong fat big word

put emphasis individual bit equipment sound choose workstation run sonic solution system always use system make endless comparison still find sound big wide strong clear sonic solution first people planet put file audio file onto computer
another system use video industry actually pioneer sound tool system come way relate
start good workstation basically use play material whatever sample rate numb signal path either digitally analog give certain sound texture use valve equipment recent device call manley slam analog limiter interest o probably warm transfer
device thick manual lot abstract blurb go design actual chip use nagra equipment
listen tape machine sit quite often part session place tape see sound wow moment people will sit know expect put onto tape listen see lke whole row face light wow hit sometimes putting tape will give couple perceivable extra db without anything
people say see engineer go mad doesnneed anything gonna pick choose use ear process record choice microphone

letlisten example

bauhaus actually havenhit bauhaus yet record company time time reissue early material technology around now much much good retrieve information tape involve remaster ad beggar banquet recording people gary numan cocteau twin bauhaus

play tape enormous amount weight record play tape monitor sound heavy listen cd do weight completely
miss much thin electronic sound try good snapshot come tape

contemporary electronic music cut bristol jungle guy house hiphop everything

rush come time after honest bring interest recent pj
harvey exactly bristol jungle demonstrate certain
music pj harvey dear darkness cut cd vinyl version

think quite interest client sit room right now mr pritchard mark work john right

reckon since maybe eight year maybe long

interest stage deliver track obviously live sydney now john west england make work process go back forth

big worry move sydney wouldn able access john easily learn much studio hear now luckily ftp site mix track normally upload server john will take server maybe call s
mix wasnquite right speak think may problem generally happy john will upload server take check
album do nail maybe first time two three track another go maybe another couple another go two three attempt john will listen live bite play track certain track stand quite vary album take time balance right track long process john moan

middle mark discover stem instead send mix track send submixes maybe three four pair open possibility deal say bass separately main track actually end think work stem make much bettersounding record

use lot take have drum bass bass vocal lot pass engineer traditionally upload ftp file talk maybe mb song upload maybe eight ten version john take think instead stem basic simple element
track reliant bass put bass bass less problem say kick drum bass relationship want bass johnlimited point add bass maybe kick
heavy always limitation separately allow push bass without affect kick kick bite weak put bass kick without affect bassline stem sound good master soon listen track bass listen two together sound good everything together way sonic solution play back

sense stage element mix master

always type engineer embrace kind addons back
exchange rory gallagher guitarist want add guitar part cut record come roadie set di box rig bite mixer put power chord live cut record
historically vinyl root live recording film set studio literally cut live wax vinyl actually use late tape come along people think origin vinyl instantaneous record medium look old cop movie state se couple detective big hat stand around disc cut machine tape phone conversation disc cut big place world now

time see question master mark tune

see depress
give good indication

even good play

question people ask point work track will end good often mp low think good work high sample rate

think low sample rate around forever think fast high datum transfer rate people will feed file barely sound alright way record tape clear

issue people come vinyl dat tape era may feed people start listen music now ear train listen horrible file
persuade bore hear

think personal realization people embrace highquality sound fine choice think listen experience quite important go back radio station everything do medium vinyl quite powerful energy people listen music way different diversity now people talk favorite music win whereas back people tend follow music poetry song message obviously political get across
part happen sound work sit
studio listen temptation record everyone wow listen sound have record mp start wouldn sit wow original master good go film company may use track fantastic recording work high sample rate use world dvd personal choice

back markquestion mark

use end low end day

work degree separation sound much good resolution mean hear everything mix also power energy vinyl power energy high sample
rate power energy record feel whether move way perhaps mp wouldn world leave mp think vital lose
run sort parallel world art look painting artist quite happily paint canvas hundred year say canvas wonmake now paint computer now happen world art audio audio bite strange wouldndream buy
camera few picture available young cinema experience widescreen fantastic compare watch fiveinch sit hand experience audio people work high fidelity sound may able deliver now future think will happen think lose opportunity peoplework form

hear sound output work worth compare input output worth probably couldnafford wonder suggestion people us need work probably computer

certainly advise compare whatever else have even advise even start track put information system finish recording try work make work apply description every sound bright harsh sound okay flat say record sound couple db quiet instance bite l amplify absolutely fine type master involve people radically move recording away
people actually do expand use think aware world haven money less make sure sound right throughout record mix need nudge nudge budget master
service engineer stick sequoia simple level task client perfectly happy andy mckay roxy music come time time do
reality good monitor good meter confidence nudge sometimes
need

much budget service

unattended ¬£ album

whole album

timelimited jason good work within workstation palette choice quite limit room gear extreme within workstation basically happy tidy

two question first wonderful lecture aspect deal sound master master process
still bite mystery still seem magic sound good define master sentence impossible

sentence

two sentence

okay presentation choice presentation go whole process computer computer will lack people call warmth personality hold simply experience part personality way
hear listen much cable many different bit equipment make choice say win use cable people come respect choice roughly
ballpark master engineer take different approach presentation present product general consumption either functional creative make


creative decision people say okay finish mix tune present world master

true quite people people couple album feedback people everyone say actually album quiet decide master next time creative decision

define get song present level everything else world

explain simple way view say album ten track string together may relate play enjoy give someone listen kitchen car whatever keep jump adjust volume track track may think okay
may decide okay take grant buy cd put player listen performance start begin finish end
guy make sure journey right journey people do
virtually unlistenable experience music fully master properly track sound good need master five ten percent fit bracket rest need help studio flat response reference monitor
system
work set say instance work
nss reputation slightly bright may hear right top end response mix room come master
record dull bassy problem people start use nss standard k eq boost bite trim bottom end tidy
way view sometimes master engineer
professional chain especially work record label idea less someone listen release pick pick bad edit bad sample edit click glitches within track perhaps people havenheard phone someone say loop click say mean look system sure enough step waveform put spotlight magnify glass listen every split 2 quite weird

lead 2 question talk much clarity precision sound think great music create unprofessionalism

take grant hear lot great track great hear end day good performance prefer people literally make music quickly problem watch spend hour hour fiddle beat 2 section track haven patience go spontaneous approach guy have spend time prepare track
give musician say now give us performance
hear track american house tune real piano player play decent people repeat loop rule term creativity whether satisfy three year line listen good miss opportunity competitive radio station will tend play pop get notice

talk listen every split 2 record talk lp experience guy decide much space track magic two second art

art yes

ever artist say much space

yes actually think gap album quite important get psyche somehow gap beat come trevor put legend album together obsess gap hold entire project

big sell cd time maybe gap help

think probably subtle though

talk monitor

make atc company west england power monitor call scm suit room work fill room easy hear miniscule change onetenth db change try monitor find hear little plus minus two db across whole range giant nearfield monitor scour website atc monitor

say prefer use analog gear sometimes drive

couple control top end receive record sound bite dull need general topend lift amongst may vocal suddenly become bite y somewhere panel become aware weird happen pleasant nip
vice unit gently de still retain top end add useful tool
sometimes need use limiter maybe output will maybe db limit have
choice limiter stc finalizer sort different device actually sound slightly different choose level sometimes have sound good level loud whether detail use may pick need good energy start may use limiter selective time

remind another question use put clamp record live performance often feedback turntable clamp cause

try have try

letsay recession hit hard people decide master recording survive sell studio gear three piece gear studio keep

lathe

move

wonderful piece equipment have keep halfinch tape machine wonderful piece equipment else have probably keep monitor listen home enjoy

thank lecture learn already mention press vinyl also change sound lose bite quality right

happen yes

anticipate master music

try project press quite strange steve winwood album island synths album high synths delicate overtone press come back factory go have remove high frequency fine small frequency record factory polish metalwork take cloth actually polish high frequency
recut add little bite high top 2 test press come back still lose 3 cut go berserk add load come back alright sometimes midrange peak feedback sound sound okay acetate soft acetate cut soft bend slightly weight stylus press isnsoft rigid rigid groove throw problem aware hear engineer cut room spray lacquer coolant try harden try mimic press havendone

mention also master music destine play club house jungle club people around scream yell able tell dj play mp vinyl make think work nothing

nice good record play accept fact people will choose play think important whoeverreleasing record feel

play vinyl release come vinyl still dancefloor tell difference mp vinyl people ask point great master

marktracks master actually little musical interlude wicked track call returner forthcoming harmonic warp recording november
music harmonic returner master

now understand move sydney question

hello track start master certain routine go go certain bit equipment first

listen feel telepathy go master people send may record colombia australia say exactly pick
approach maybe couple approach sometimes give people choice
franz ferdinand album moment unattended exactly give maybe couple db
difference level brief job hammer level everything part loudness war take everything steady dynamic turn session loud aware push sometimes totally sure couple happen give choice back customer may use download cd vinyl set way finite amount equipment room

back loudness question mainly pop music everyone try make song loud possible music get compress see five year

difficult think two high level especially hot band block liter water put liter water liter bottle cd ceil way people music notice find clever way compress limit crank whole sound thrash grunge band heavy metal whatever part sound problem aware record natural maximum level
sometimes take little work sometimes perhaps leave day back decide loud common first instinct think come work vinyl go slightly loud rein back little bite window rein back far become little interest sound reverbs go background impact window work try work within window

say five ten percent material receive need master always case change since s

change quite first start studio remember receive recording oneone copy master come track album job splice copy together complete utter surprise sound fine
level change require everything work level think come everybodytraining record engineer fairly formal train equipment design work certain way
vu meter tape machine people work roughly zero dolby unit noise reduction unit take away tape hiss work certain level
production staff whatever music actually little finish master mix happen custom master exist make record actually send factory put cut
master come believe start little state people realize little bite first studio work trident cut room main build department large studio abbey
road cut room decca change introduction studio workstation lack use big record studio

wrap valuable
russ elevado involve yesterday talk musician
performance mix performance anyone alter afterwards long baby anyone touch mix engineer expect
master process
russ elevado
good question mix point work hour hour expect master engineer listen first see sound album start normal chain especially isn standard style mix anymore everything loud compress linear
mine loud everybody else dynamic stay sort tweak touch low touch high pull middle little bite normally expect master engineer album plus putting l anything believe end putting compressor run mix vintage equipment

involve therefore artist master stage
russ elevado
do full album even half city definitely go session pretty much master master engineer use two people will start use john now meet whole time artist will come stay involve master make sure doesnmess mix mess mix pull whole db certain frequency master engineer experience ruin whole vision album concept
question though process bring level cd standard make loud standard way bring cd standard computer process level

personally stand change level domain come try time time remember long time ago acoustic album need five db gain seven eight place system change gain exactly six db think see happen set think theoretically mathematically end six file sound exactly horror file sound totally incoherent fall apart other sound harsh wasn bad
point realize string number dodgy source studio whether halfinch within reason play flat come quite often converter sound sound digitize musical tend level change analog present have converter correct level cd go onto workstation workstation edit fade present material whatever medium
store cd end
will possibly workstation occasionally will put little bass filter plug pop mix occasionally thump drum kit maybe fancy level adjustment rather awkward crossfade say engineer percent level adjustment already do time get destination workstation already zero go high level set generally discussion client see project amongst everyone else people go
dynamic kick
quite uk hiphop compare serious dr dre level go home rethink time push level otherwise wonsound mean anything level arenright depend genre dynamic
aside classical engineer come say touch already peak zero put system transfer digitally change sit listen say may peak zero sound db quiet anything else big brain strain think oh god change sound five db still sound little originally end result quite big approach minimalist way skill
russ elevado
pro world zero vu cd relative zero vu pro world

zero vu normally minus cd scale different institution different people slight variation reason see drum beat peak zero vu meter electronic level db high huge difference way peak meter read sound workstation use standard vu meter switch give different set

people feel call become master engineer inevitably aspect engineer learn eq become interest talk delicate approach science art master recommend bud master engineer train learn master year hardly ever meet other talk different approach intrigue hear school standard way learn

couple book isn

bob katz bit piece think learn experience way record learn experience privilege come industry time learn experience huge able look forward look backwards apply sensible engineer technique bring good learn past current
good experience place actually master different engineer definitely respect term work sit use audio workstation wouldnpass single sound yet respect work definitely slightly style suppose introduce place even ask whether couple day make tea help people come quite sit around day get bite bore come day
