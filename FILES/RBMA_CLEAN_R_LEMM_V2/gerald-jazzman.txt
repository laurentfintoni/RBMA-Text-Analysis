example type record play

play fred williams people may recognize talib kweli sample recently track numb seven
music fred williams tell
anyone recognize talib kweli use recently remember song inaudible suggestion camera

album call midwest funk tornado alley mean cd much care love go almost mini essay must take year

take us two three year american issue stone throw release state take age say meet artist producer right interview story information otherwise nothing internet nothing try properly otherwise story never get tell

now picture record record people pay money album real money people spend always real superexpensive buy market

tend way actually



probably look single song three minute long independently make quite rare probably make hundred time band probably make single single rare expensive probably encapsulate sole artistic output band condense single single album anything else concentration musical legacy little three minute song concentrate little think value art go whole album load load album spread across output mean think value artisticness spread dilute think people value single concentration output specific little three minute long concentrate

expensive song hear

northern soul record tend sell money garage record garage record northern soul record wouldnbat eyelid spend thousand thousand pound

song example

couldntell northern garage collector story look high price ebay funk sell many uncommon see four figure seven inch single funk music dealingwith fornorthern little recordsandmore people demand high supply low assimple supply demand

pay money record make excuse say reissue allow

anyoneever pay record

pay couple thousand pound single couple occasion guy want pay pretty much worth two know copy world price

year year buy record still buzz hear record nothing stand way

wouldnmind copy fred williams play copy sometimes record get skin inside head gotta cd isn gotta original artifact take month year find miss opportunity may never see gotta bite bullet spend money record people balk pay sort price see anyone anyone find cheap record sell ebay put enough money paypal account enough time eventually enough money paypal account buy record matter work find record bother buy sell money need certain amount dedication certain manpower real trick say early spend money record trick find cheap nothing clever spend thousand pound record find record fifty cent dollar cleverness way say must emphasize uh find record dollar rare meet office rare record example instance bell guy talk copy funky corner worth thousand pound whatever say sell say oh ten buck um couldntake ten dollar soon late have find worth money have start hate us have take advantage couldn anything people idea pay artist proper price record take advantage

say people say may collect stamp marble mean people obsessive culture seem hoard

stamp collector reason collect stamp everyone reason music believe musician create record first place music first place able express people listen enjoy dance record collector buy keep dj cover tell anyone think disrespectful essence music make first place cover record another reason reissue spread music otherwise opportunity spread first place reason reissue anything everyone reason believe spread main reason philosophy behind label

must say percent hear reissue never ever hear play couple give idea long since many put

think start seven eight per year try every month easy song call new generation universal another funk
music universal new generation

now beatmakers sit room hear record particular way certain bit record spring producer year always traditionally come see london hte people buy break

buy break anymore use sort change last year hiphop producer buy drum past rather pmgong guy want every single record drum break even rubbish record otherwise pay whatever take pete rock buy record um king havenseen people quite now guy public enemy forget name whose record collection burn bite grim anyway guy say people sample record anymore make beat

contemporary music

much time stick past basically generally much say stick old day much traditional sense band feel big combination group people play together musical instrument busy research time new think current favorite band broadcast birmingham england

mean obviously dj play big part keep vinyl culture alive healthy even djing start move realm serato computer djing will always community people look buy rare record will ever die will become

think will die eventually soon late many record must billion disappear overnight literally many even people move onto computer onto modern form music storage always people music regardless format mean listen single will deny fact decrease doesnmean say go forever many around happen

think happen matter way tape roll sometimes doesngo

doesn take time happen say say original release 2 release

necessarily record actually master cut month record tape sit shelf come across record record release four year difference four year may print time talk hand condition tape store think think infer repress little bite sound begin usually especially single never repress do different color label different matrix numb look internet look various book swiss book call funk lexicon write guy call peter wermelinger write actual matrix number around label tell original press record

thank also start go record label go storage go old tape print

usually people deal time individual happen band odd year ago usually private individual today rather record company record interest small label independent may two release aren record company occasionally record company will archive tape pretty rare single interest nature obscure mean handful release label never develop fullyfledged record company huge back catalog eat someone universal now

tape actually follow sorry ask question oneshot deal tape fall apart end stressful

happen snap stretch fragile haven use year year actually tape bad one right tape late bad shed say process put oven bake special place bake adhesive stick actual metal particle actual base tape come apart bake stick back together pretty effective pretty good sound end

cook reelreel tape basically

oven home special place do do do transfer knackered use do digitize keep forever permanent

ever come across anything fake somebody release recently try make rare record

mean someone release now record now pretend do year ago think have able tell sound quality record say year ago do analog equipment old microphone old technique tell mile do now hear many old record occasionally may trick bite pretty difficult think now less have record old equipment old manner old technique master press old way sound now totally different sound record do old day different

ever find hear sample song hasn clear ever get legality people ever call mean incredible wealth knowledge sure recognize sample people

mean many people use sample now people quite high profile clear talib kweli mention early clear us use sell hell record result clear obviously do mean people line exploit music release get compensate local record someone mixtape great scheme huge significance doesn matter think issue

never sort catch someone anything

issue people bootleg interest copyright call tell sort go bite generally past people little bootleg small fly operation copy nothing people try sell thousand thousand copy try pass reissue legal many leave people keen try generally find anyway actually

copyright available download service remember idea make sure music spend time uncover basically represent properly medium whether record cd download appropriate royalty filter whoever own copyright money make cd contractually oblige filter proper royalty people actually make music producer record company whoever own first place regardless whether release internet cd make difference format long royalty pay end day important

actually put small command mention maybe smart pay money certain particular record maybe try find another place buy two dollar five year ago meet british guy karminsky experience maybe



collect strange weird sound incredible strange music go store moscow actually find five record like store quite expensive buy say wow think wouldnbuy dollar think actually pay price record record rare difficult evaluate actually sound cost sound believe need actually sound rare certain quantity copy think smart forget record cost expect

true maybe much money time everyone limit record people specifically say right will pay ten pound twenty pound hundred pound record matter much mean keep control finance everyone limit spend may record say may limit may like another record much cost half price everyonedifferent everyone mean assess value much pay even market value suppose record hundred pound everyone world sell five hundred mean get bargain essence four hundred pound cheap rate may still buy fact limit hand may buy know sell five hundred everyone reason want buy certain price

question research music time frame discover anything studio technique micing technique

malcolm work drummer red bull workshop couple year ago actually build studio use old gear whenever go together meet guy especially producer ask technique sometimes buy equipment find personally much interest busy learn quite bite especially drum placement mic placement drum definitely art lose think year basically people record band much studio past people obviously use tape day use equipment whether compressor rdqs whatever much now do computer technique lose day definitely wish know bite never need sort go bite head talk together

whole resurgence quantic now come sort try trace back sort sound think renew interest friend maybe last two four year start back seven inch sort learn discover true music quantic tru thought

think certain extent people maybe hear seven inch first time old funk single first time captivate different sound dynamic sound cd people may much people wow never hear anything sound fresh ear keen start look try sort sound try record now think benefit sound lose year way sound quite authentic

nostalgic

nostalgic way nostalgic hear never hear nothing compare sound new way people now hear music do digitally computer hear analog record first time hear vinyl sound totally different sound fresh sound new even though do do year year hasn do modern context old play now come now

wonder listen home sound quality switch radio hear feel ear maybe

sound good doesn inside think listen friend mine put new system car bass deep grind treble sound awesome doesn ear doesn inside bone feel much think technically pretty good feel term normal music try imagine band play imagine drummer play kick drum bass player play bass low doesnseem real personally appreciate music properly imagine real play people personal viewpoint music enjoy feel passionate human touch music music artificially create sound nice everything feel

obviously important give back artist due everything ever situation may sort reopen old wind example artist rip label year ago year ago come along rereleased label owner say hey cut whatever

tricky sometimes occasion open worm talk someone say oh copyright owner pay money talk guitarist say oh talk drummer say start argue everything occasion instance record play early universal new generation happen save money together make record record send distributor store somewhere along line lose record never actually turn spend money nothing disappear somewhere even properly press band hell money start wasn commercially successful put money venture nothing effect completely stitch rip whoever make record pretty tough year actually release properly say early people expect think try pay able record put cd appreciate put first place

maybe indicative wild west attitude back day

pretty bad back day rule back day music business tricky industry shark mean still bad now obviously day little collection society little regulation normal pay dj backhanded play record radio use wit imagination hustle skill whatever record press first place tricky business now record hear oppose someone else hustle

sorry hog mic sorry people another question artist rereleased say find nurse home maybe reignite opportunity tour come retirement

wish try organize band bring mind soul tornado base akron ohio two brother play bass play organ say look together bring england record pay guy california pay together hurdle everything main problem money end day minority music sell shitloads copy make million pound able band afford fly way uk gig make cost effective easy try sum add unfortunately maybe person say singer even two gig forte promote another cat fish altogether enough able promote concert band gig else entirely much have people whole band even band singer quite difficult good able basically pass detail people adrian gibson jazz café main people interest sort say look numb give call come
november get robert moore soul singer florida come perform help pay adriangetting record speedometer actually put single try two gig instead much intention easy especially mostly plane flight everything expense involve otherwise have love people people work marlena shaw come regularly now people spanky wilson quanticgetting involve gwen mccrae come quite quite good reputation able come uk little minitour go europe say time involve

curious past numb year quite mess old jazz label impulse blue note verve open back catalog remix wonder concept happy let go sort sacrilege

havenactually hear anything keep music alive record make year ago doesnmean say overlook havenheard new far concern whether record yesterday year ago people complain old music say doesnsound new doesnsound modern anything havenheard say old music still new ear need modern touch able peopleears think good sense certainly make people realize old music even modernize may turn people look back past see back appreciate especially hear side side

situation material put jazzman come master tape people interest step

quantic remix first song play early sometimes feel motherless child quantic remix do sense people ask us generally time follow quite honestly many project people say remix top agendum much work keep putting new rather remix old have think whole new format label put time go direction
