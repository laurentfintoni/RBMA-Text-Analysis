first modular system module control various aspect sound depend module wire together knob set accord composerpreference often play realtime performance environment

good picture time talk



buchla box already talk pretty highly sophisticate device

develop cbs fund effort develop modular system dimension original new capability long abandon series call introduce e differ preset storage store make configuration knob setting push button preset restore proper command name save restore result pulse address action store preset particular concert

stage able include different design box mean way start particular model follow today go oh model program follow example start much simple basic technology idea another way think possibility within create sound electronically use word artificially

begin roughly actually do electronic sound mostly aid tape recorder know tape composer

tape compose essence great grandfather sample guess

go back long way work synthesis time mark rca much early instrument take look picture

particular moment orson welles war world think oh else sound symphonic orchestra initial key moment go whoa

nasa

first time build computer supportable flight never fly interest build computer couldn disrupt cosmic ray essentially physiology observe highaltitude balloon fly across canada recover check yeast permutation yeast high several generation flight across canada watch highaltitude balloon newfoundland track radio small plane pick sometimes pacific usually forest eastern western canada late work various project navigation visibility problem encounter spaceship relatively recent

true close silicon valley nasa huge center office embarrassingly little compare military term research

stage grant understand

build first cost great deal rockefeller give build first synthesizer

jayz rocfella original rockefeller

rockefeller foundation

actually aim say form fill grant

fill form grant directly san francisco tape music center institute ramon sender give rockefeller money great deal even much

basically ring modulator understand correctly

different module ring modulation several process

bite hand make design ring modulator easy right

yes yes

come

build good balance modulator knowledge never study electronic pick build project nasa

mum look crazy ring modulator tell

demonstrate

happen

kind strange ringmodulated sound

sound

sorry hum tune

another interest era produce sound also technology take different place downstairs example limiter compressor use photo cell understand guy use early photo technology create sound

case yes

first moment think lightning sound explain little bite use photo cell creation sound

lightning come much late optical length need transmitter consist lead receptor consist silicon diode talk may technique use early gate still use technique optic coupler use lead cadmium selenide cell closely couple far apart

envision happen load guy white suit big mask everything dustfree set work

even clean room

close repair old car

possibly

maybe solder radio car

work bench modern instrument help develop

time still little tinker around little hobbyist level right

never much hobbyist

paraphrase

develop relatively sophisticate design think model happy design design usually first take production model design panel design create still build originally design use production time go prototype stage

talk baby day analogue synthesis use musician always interest day people opposite end world may similar obviously people research similar way create art electric sound part america hear first other

perhaps hear bob moog first synthesizer almost time us work west coast aesthetic robert moog work east coast totally different aesthetic strangely build similar module interconnection philosophy quite different

view competition

initially think yes become good friend merge many operation design moog equipment fact much late ignore ten year

stage work similar different approach industry yet speak clear indication money make

always fringe activity need go work other include nasa sometimes synthesizer manufacturer design earn keep

come first synthesizer relatively together almost within year give speed time mediation event almost time take explain pretty fundamental difference approach will lead us main subject guess interface humanmachine interaction

letsee think primary difference approach separate audio signal control signal fact use two different quartz even present synthesizer robert moog take now call balance modulator ring modulator use gate break dc take audio oscillator program subaudio oscillator case turn control use else
system capability want high performance possible want ring modulator extremely low leakage extremely high signal noise couldnwork gate offset signal zero reference oscillate reference control voltage different range zero somewhere range totally different two system moog jack signal headroom system work require headroom relatively small may two volt amplitude go volt amplitude
difference control quite different input level audio signal control pot know exponential audio taper control moogequipment linear disadvantage make disadvantage simple conceptual disadvantage look complex patch look wire tell one handle signal one handle control voltage

give us idea cabinet modular system size stage

cabinet three module high gesture hand module seven inch high multiple fourquarter inch wide fourquarter subdivision width fit inch rack nobody ever use rack mount system choose fourquarter seven format choose format use even currently

many sound complex patch size

great numb sound

time

may use overdubbing awful sound time use live performance without aid tape process anything listen early work silver apple moon first commission nonesuch make approximately believe use much overdubbing use two revox reelreel tape machine break channel wouldnrecord pretty intact much mean resource tape bounce anything

another interest aspect take also include sequencer early form go even maybe even grandfather mpc way

think think sequencer stage eliminate tape splice still tape four level people start use rhythmic make great use sequencer early tape soon become current sequencer now think replacement tape rather creation rhythmic element music

device consider sequencer

think simple tape splice voltage control new important aspect voltage control couldnmake oscillator jump instantaneously different frequency turn knob alternative make tape cut tape
visit columbiaprinceton laboratory fact build three four original studio reel reel tape across top want half 2 eflat have chop section eflat have long intricate tape assemblage little piece tape make quite composition extra tape already prerecord certain precise frequency piece much tune use laboratory sinewave oscillator make tape full csharp amaze
good story take three synthesizer make identical lab graduate move lab find identical array equipment exception lab reserve faculty graduate student other undergraduate come vladimir ussachesvsky cover module make faculty lab big random voltage source source uncertainty call make white noise random voltage fairly complex way randomness music grad student often undergrad student tape couldn

probably stress term us familiar see many plug box white noise pink noise love fact dub source uncertainty

combine random problem moog approach white noise isn useful random voltage fluctuate random voltage vary probable speed pulse random voltage sample modern get kind distribution shape white noise actually normally hear white tricky circuitwise make call flat noise system flat noise plusdb noise call white noise actually db term energy per octave db sound bassy white noise easy generate flat noise difficult make think one incorporate flat noise system also good filter equal bass treble noise use white noise orient towards treble

guess aware especially amongst nerd word oh approach approach guy interact explain different thought behind keyboard concept take far control noise sound uncertainty

keyboard time certainly interest piano background speak say pitch have good use pitch use pitch build alternative keyboard simply look familiar black white think psychological take keyboard enough turn another direction

speak psychology keyboard first create model cembalo harpsichord th century pretty deliberate effort go welltuned piano already compromise part countercultural approach rebel
