context theatre record jim o rourke
music ktl paraug
say great listen genelecspeakers cool

band early fusion black metal psychedelic guitar computer simply do other
though since havenlistened album
now quite melodic actually

ear tune sort style sure say
grow say synthesis
rather hear element suppose
function work length get good
figure go

chemistry evolve collaborate someone long
period time interest reward
music sense creativity expression
idea reflect filter
absorb deny year come trust learn listen differently music

much solo

sometimes play solo tomorrow concert
last couple year quite difficult
communication another musician ego trip way
come realise much value communication
collaborate play musician solo

immediately respect work see play france
confuse happen fascinate
strong encounter think great
opportunity try different also base
music scene involve type artist work
similar idea actually light artist work play
name patrick riou french old guy work
theatre film year incredible minimalist use
can create quite dramatic mean see
clip light design clip opportunity
learn form field directly

must quite eyeopening oh
except completely different format

try figure way cohesive collaborate
person play also will disappear
diffusion use spatialisation mean channel
speaker system around audience four subwoofer stack
pretty fun use software build max build
organization call ircam paris
collaborate basically create numb simulate acoustic
space room acoustic space
forest canyon small room various
move sound source field
theoretical practical actually pretty interest way
collaborate light light director patrick bring
depth field close tell stage ten metre
deep whatever have make move seem
sensation depth open
inspire bring spatialisation tool use
composition music try complement sound
work tool little bite deceptive micro
manage every aspect audience experience
first time even learn much
effective suggest make precise movement
sound space example rather move accomplish sort sensation audience

chance need employ patience skill
okay hold need whizzbang every moment

exactly work new piece actually call pyre will
premiere next month france use spatialisation re
use bite differently much simple way actually
programmer build space fader okay now
large outdoor space whatever bring
spatialisation now possible ableton max
live algorithm algorithm reverb
multichannel ableton spatialisation people engineer work ircam guy make multichannel new ableton manuel
poletti name

use ableton quite bite

theatre great useful diffusion call playback

answer way curious come
metal background scene crucial record open abstract experimental music

hard pin album earth big part
though earth hear metalhead teenager
heavy death metal record drum
sing talk guy call lamonte young guy
call pandit pran nath people universe continually open

guitar process everything guitar process play tomorrow
night chance listen gear maniac look
set wow interest use
way never consider

set look assume quite different depend
group context

use point make
change tone tool carpenter make
different tool use reverb delay love tape
delay modded rat pedal important
effect set switch allow four channel simultaneously
individually phase control channel play several
amplifier amplifier phase
tune phase phase make incredible
difference tone course real gamechanger piece
gear

come play



say modded pedal modding

work couple guy build
mean make cable basic solder
come gut skill people
good even begin

talk say go describe
x

recently work guy russia unit two
