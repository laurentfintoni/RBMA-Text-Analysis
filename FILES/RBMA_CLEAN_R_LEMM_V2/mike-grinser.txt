listen electronic music last decade probably hear work person sit next couch even may never hear name master engineer work two renowned master studio berlin dubplates master manmade master partner tim xavier please join welcome

welcome thank come

master today people audience people interest audio general sort black box visual aid project bite go process granulary possible
think important first music general decide become master engineer especially introduction electronic music

introduction electronic music end pretty much rock guy grunge music nirvana band point first hear electronic music chicago guess band phuture example quite impress sound music want new sound music do start point electronic music end begin s

time expose phuture first place

still live countryside grow small village south germany bavaria still live countryside club friend mine run club hang djing happen basically

quickly go hear phuture djing

djing towards end crossover sound go hiphop rock electronic quite huge variety mixture different style music

certain point start music much technical level oppose purely musical

always quite technically interest start produce music interest produce electronic music release first record test cut dubplate play dj always try go studio go master studio sit session point interest mainly music come wax

time produce music still live hometown

still live hometown leave quite shortly begin land munich study university access quite famous club call ultraschall owner club also record label accident idea produce release music find home record label call disko b

people may familiar talk little bite sound ultraschall associate time

sound ultraschall associate mainly techno international dj book club dj detroit american guy also people austria club relationship us underground resistance detroit people chicago people also continental europe vienna example guy

mention name now label feel sound record come time musical level technical level already think way improve

guess guess sound especially electronic dance music time decade nowadays pretty much change pretty rough studio much process gear maybe also much come vinyl cut

think simply knowledge wasnavailable accessible way people interest way now

accessible people work master industry now knowledge selftaught easy especially come vinyl access knowledge go study need find people mentor show think back people transfer music disc knowledge selftaught adapt mentor

mentor

mentor produce music first also accident tobias neumann happen studio studio give us vocal booth small production studio first mixdowns show couple trick skill late start master career nowadays partner tim xavier show cut system work show transfer music time bring tim american guy point move studio brooklyn berlin own american cut system scully westrex cut system first learn system late meet christoph grotebeverborg dubplates master owner dubplates master late show cut neumann vms system

look photo bring bite late difference neumann scully describe think talk master far havenanswered basic question master someone regular consumer music care master

basic speak master bridge production duplication bridge production record mix studio world music get release get master may transfer medium another medium master medium master studio speed electro disc vinyl manufacture datum set letsay cd production get send press plant press plant replicate master duplicate
2 part question someone worry master master also last technical also last creative step music production master make sure music translate different listen environment different playback medium good master will translate will also help sale guess good sound product end

curious answer give have first start master engineer approach differently year first start work tim xavier first sort get foot wet sort acquire knowledge

begin basically start master everything else come late think first gain knowledge feel possible possible master work leave right stereo sound access individual instrument record work stereo sound apply process full mixdown little go long away adjust frequency domain part influence totally different part every engineer find path way gain knowledge approach music apply process

talk lesson though first start think master describe sort balance formal education maybe learn someone directly informal actually sit behind lathe process chain master learn job

think think important educate ear technical manner also artistic way need learn lesson think gain intuition start work project collection recording sometimes recording make studio band producer land master studio also collection different compilation example need feel start land end

now mention balance technical artistic artistic master

think important work music treat music people respect musicality music also emotion music feel band producer mean record go record mixdown do lack different aspect producer able fulfill idea production arrangement mixdown need help objective ear master engineer
master engineer music hear first time allow lend producer musician objective ear apply process accordingly find balance benefit sacrifice say every process step necessarily benefit first sacrifice add process add little bite noise every process step do right order achieve good result

much people send record master much master process change last decade since first start factor contribute someone ask completely different record possibly exact genre music versus record similar

yes think nowadays come record example people expect record sound cd

mean record sound cd

little artifact possible come vinyl quality playback outside inside change pretty much distance shrink towards inside make difficult playback system cartridge read information
regard electronic music example energy distribute throughout frequency range range hear hertz kilohertz change pretty much record much information hz nowadays bass drum rather around hz

reason shift specifically

think back day want record record need book studio probably daily basis easily quite expensive new technical possibility record computer different daws pretty much democratic influence music produce music mix nowadays easily accessible everyone computer daw couple plugins produce music back day much difficult band musician need big record label afford book studio

consumer expectation also impact work ask



producer want



someone listen

hard say musician producer expect apply little bite enhance music transfer process other expect change sound transform sound deep process master engineer feel necessary project record hand

actual consumer say someone last year listen change cd stream vinyl back stream different avenue particularly come relatively new people stream affect artist master compete sort field

whether artist think much think profession also train people nowadays often deliver different set master different platform music get release nowadays often release different medium letsay vinyl cd medium also medium quite big difference online distribute music file mp wave aiff people download stream service nowadays quite difficult spread information people release music distributor distributor different aggregate place music different stream platform download shop spread information master platform lose quite difficult think us engineer train people spread knowledge good medium

term good particular see people constantly misinterpret think case loudness

yes yes problem still people ask loud file think someone search music online record shop argument buy file buy record sound loud certain degree true always exist already exist back music play radio suddenly song play radio sound loud song always argument listener consumer buy
year ago reach quite crazy amount loudness people still ask quite high loudness also us train people tell always good idea excessive loudness imply problem playback club sound system example amplifier speaker cabinet start distort start overdrive also music play radio music stream online almost stream platform loudness correction algorithm build

mean exactly

algorithm measure loudness song accessible match certain loudness influence sound also frequency pattern record master loud music stream algorithm will measure change loudness also frequency content

have sacrifice dynamic range master step reach point enforce stream service anyway

yes yes stream platform loudness minus loudness unit different measurement compare peak rm music distribute online people buy file loudness much much high find good idea either see whether client will step back loudness may consider two different set master

frequently find client actually amenable objective recommendation make

say client open ear

ask name name

good think master engineer also style doesnmean always print print master little bite loud other little bite low little bite low end high end master different time producer artist musician pick master studio master engineer example online discogs look engineer master cut record release quite good resource people find preference engineer work also come attend session always recommend inside happen studio happen master also feel work personal connection always good idea come release music master music

go back little bite talk individual master engineer sort signature people first start master first start get interest study record without actually access

back release music pretty much know want go always music collector listen different kind different style music idea want go want work maybe also try different place release find perfect match

although master also quite expensive depend studio difficult people actually reach level first get someone sign release believe sign put money master multiple people will give shoot different studio right

mean master take time take studio time studio build philosophy studio work peoplemusic good end result sound good possible mean need build process chain need think acoustic monitor run studio cost money ask artist client pay master sure pay hand also take part money reinvest studio make good improve

big mistake see people send file master



send frustrate

different first find important leave little bite head room record music us master engineer work tell daw measure dbfs mean db full scale full scale recommend leave little bite head room around three dbfs decibel relative full scale peak head room
also work sample rate less sample rate final medium case cd khz also work high good idea example use double sample rate final product case cd use example film music music video khz use way round issue go sample rate k k uneven number conversion good converter round round number will always round artifact problem music center rhythm important rhythm instrument phase reverse rhythmical instrument percussion bass drum snare drum correct regard polarity

become issue

signal right polarity will positive waveform follow negative waveform positive waveform connect right way proper way positive waveform cause speaker cone move outside negative part waveform will let cone move inside influence punch impact example regard frequency range also good idea individual instrument record dynamically control good way several instrument play time influence instrument modulate mask instrument control different part frequency domain right way dynamically will little mask modulation artifact
sometimes especially come vinyl good idea high end control possible cut problem come excessive high end sibilance high hit crashesphonemes vocal sibilance phoneme vocal strong sawtooth waveform sawtooth waveform complex complex problem playback cut system always superior compare playback system call vinyl distortion distortion come cut process playback
another watch control low end doesn muddy instrument low end bassline bass drum low tom congas separate low end get muddy think s

keep track

yes

letsay hit right point doesn problem describe think good opportunity segue actually process chain start master particular track bring example maybe bring now talk process chain manmade master studio letassume nothing problem whatever track come

show screen right show grinser bring photograph overhead screen

go maybe talk bite people see

see part process chain manmade master design process chain try keep versatile collection instrument processor allow access different part frequency domain basically mixture hybrid mixture piece gear plugins white piece bottom two processor sevenband minimum phase eq compressorlimiter deesser digitally

first piece expand seven band repeat

sevenband minimum phase equalizer mainly use clean spectrum try describe instrument modulate mask signal record record room room resonance example record use eq band find modulation artifact resonance dip narrowband parametric filter process chain say part analog part router analog router connect together quite freely decide process chain piece gear use piece gear leave process chain

important listen environment

listen environment come master find important say first time listen record spend time new master doesntake much time compare record mixdown example manmade studio plan half hour work track sometimes minute minute sometimes also minute around half hour give opportunity take right decision good listen environment good acoustic good monitor system will help take right decision
come tonal balance important master balance letsay listen environment lack low end frequency low end may cancel other add due room resonance make hard take decision need low end need little low end much low end master will always sound quiet compare good balance master imply problem therefore good listen environment welltreated room wellset speaker system help master benefit

take us element process chain

middle see screen right see monitor meter system opportunity meter frequency spectrum also leftright relationship correlation meter coulometer monitor frequency balance also stereo image bottom picture right see monitor controller monitor controller find important master studio basically monitor part mix desk source turntable feedback information cut system output daw analog output output connect switch knob compare b compare record master example
source monitor controller choose level offset proper b comparison art form compare master premaster example important loudness match exactly ear pretty sensitive regard level even untrained ear half db level difference think loud good even play two time mixdown half db loud clearly point half db loud say good although difference level difference monitor controller mix combine daw make easy b comparison wherever process chain compare different medium

else happen actually start cut record

time nowadays pretty good bandwidth internet example call master approval someone come session send project internet master project master file end artist attend session prefer send home master familiar listen environment first time maybe spend studio will probably impress studio listen environment monitor system gear find find good idea artist possibility take master home check listen environment car stereo studio dj play give notice whether good master artist enjoy master 2 step prepare transfer session transfer master medium mostly daw nowadays lacquer disc example acetate vinyl manufacture

bring image lathe use cut mention little bite early learn scully lathe

yes

guess now neumann

yes

may good talk difference learn curve may different one maybe even make fullscreen people flip
still manmade master actually cut file

call cut system cut lathe cut desk cut system electronic component fine mechanic component see platter small actual heart machine cutter flip different picture see good see platter inch master cut leave black microscope order operator engineer able check groove microscope different example decide cut depth depth groove check whether cut stylus still good quality

long stylus last

stylus depend nowadays often problem supply vinyl acetate lacquer stylus quality vary neumann spec cut hour much cut stylus either ruby sapphire shape round time stylus also break letsay roughly around cut hour also decide quality stylus visually look microscope also listen blank groove cut blank groove groove without modulation groove without music listen decide noise floor
lacquer cut artifact vinyl crack artifact pop tick stylus good hear little bite white noise due playback stylus travel inside groove cause white noise artifact vinyl add different process press plant
right see instrument measure pressure delicate part cut system cutter head piece cutter head translate incoming electrical signal modulational vibration letsay send pure sine tone cut system thousand cycle mean thousand hz khz cut stylus vibrate thousand time leave right mono signal cutter head quite strong electromagnet coil form coil form start vibrate accord electrical incoming signal magnetic field coil form connect cut stylus cut stylus see cutter bottom flip see cut stylus mount
also see two wire order less amount noise introduce record groove cut stylus heat similar cut knife butter use hot knife warm knife flank cut much precise compare cold knife similar
pressure meter show cutter head close system depend amount high frequency signal quite warm hot inside cutter heat system close heat go somewhere use helium cool coil form give long life
see close cutter cut stylus stylus cut groove surface lacquer aluminum plate aluminum plate coat nitrate cellulose lacquer groove cut lacquer surface cut stylus cut groove material cut order modulation sacrifice cutout material cut system vacuum system suck chip call chip basically string lacquer low pressure suck chip travel small pipe

go wrong stage actually cut groove lacquer lacquer send press plant sort see groove mention microscope actually look cut see groove sign may irregular actually cause problem press plant

see clean groove couple picture groove groove see take picture mobile phone ocular microscope see couple groove modulate groove groove three maybe four white line two white line outside groove flank blurry line middle bottom groove part bottom groove groove flank need microscope microscope light groove highlight see ocular see clean white blurry line
also check microscope make sure cut happen groove modulate cut system will cut spiral towards inside groove modulate need part cut system drive cutter head cut spiral without groove ever touch collide groove touch collide collide skip playback touch cause problem process press plant high amount noise
see four groove big excursion low end information tiny detail inside groove midhigh frequency stereo information
cut stereo signal groove work groove two signal groove two groove flank groove flank carry signal flank leave signal flank right signal stereo information will time difference leave right phase difference leave right system build call call system mean coil form angle degree surface record time difference phase offset leave right horizontal lateral information call also vertical information show groove high electron microscope see detail groove see groove quite complex depend frequency phase content cut stylus have movement leave right

listen record final version master record pleasure process give highly technical keep interest master may seem esoteric talk have groove depth variation groove describe even maintenance cutter head keep excite spend significant amount time

personally begin see first time always find piece art miracle cut music take plate put turntable listen without buy record piece art always wow crazy

bring actually cut separate press cut dubplate want use example listen

bring couple record press record also cut couple snippet dubplate dubplate lacquer disc difference diameter size different cut use inch lacquer now bring dubplates

demonstrate dubplate exactly

have demonstrate playback issue outside inside say distance groove rotation outside inside change change rotation rpm always second matter whether finger outside inside distance shrink towards inside make much hard playback cartridge track information especially highfrequency information detail part groove
show

also mean maximum cut onto record still high fidelity possible

depend pretty much record home may notice record different loudness may find record quiet another record record much loud compare lp record example play snippet play example vinyl
now snippet inside sound play example vinyl
different part song 2 snippet information high frequency play example vinyl outside now listen inside play example vinyl
think even listen environment perfect b listen test hear quite clear difference high frequency content outside inside want release music record couple keep mind several track side record good idea place track high amount high frequency content towards outside dull track towards inside example high time vinyl lp track place make sense regard medium mean ballad song little highfrequency content sparse arrangement place inside energetic track track high amount highfrequencies place outside
come record also good idea keep play time mind say loudness record mainly mainly relate time per side mean short play time side loud record cut take electronic music two different rotation speed rpm rpm rpm play time without lose level nine minute rpm bite long record spin slow around minute everything exceed play time need reduce level
letsay make record play dj doesnmake much sense put minute side record level loudness quite low make hard dj mix set record dj play definitely much loud quiet record make hard dj play release lp album hifi listen home listen find practical play time minute minute maximum minute opinion doesn make sense

bring couple record work maybe listen two think have interest talk record bring particular challenge relative people think either master general relate individual element

hard speak change record time

hold

quite interest project time ago nowadays last year quite rerelease project label people beautiful reissue sure quite sometimes master medium available record record love life orchestra peter gordon peter gordon part arthur russell band master master tape master file record find good new old stock copy discogs record record track label send recording another studio good process gear work spectrum record reduce vinyl artifact reduce crackle reduce pop tick file send back master music cut play

lethear sound

record also master

love life orchestra

love life orchestra song call condo record
music love life orchestra condo

now master comparison

source vinyl
pretty much depend music vinyl nice medium vinyl physical limitation cut vinyl playback sound vinyl close way hear certain music example experimental music music square wave form aggressive music vinyl may good medium physically quite limit regard frequency content regard phase relationship leave right channel

good keep mind even vinyl release name doesnnecessarily mean good possible format music come

yes yes

think probably still barely scratch surface

still

wanna thank come today share knowledge master think probably illuminate people audience much thank mike

thank thank hope chance show different task master little bite insight happen black box master studio thank come

question audience see hand already microphone come keep hit gonna hit stop

hello ask two question think realistically difference analog master nowadays also people buy hardware master software plugins recommend achieve professional sound

difference letsay part master nowadays do purely example limit nowadays purely task difference nowadays algorithm computer process power good achieve good result process difference workflow analog output piece also output piece help concentrate music work little screen parameter number
2 part question good good software master limiter also eq recently picture show white piece gear swiss company call weiss compressor call weiss d recently plug release emulation code port plug sonically transparent interest

cool thank much

want ask first every month every week new isotope plugins vsts whatever come try take job say embrace opportunity bedroom producer budget huge master challenge 2 part question think artificial intelligence may way master next year

think new produce produce play music dj example use automate process different option use idea happen think music quite personal art personal emotion think artificial intelligence wouldn help basic concept music

thank

hello thank information give us insightful question regard technical say train ear technical also preference taste line draw accord taste instance receive production master feel sound inspire draw line taste basically technically line two

basically go studio leave taste door work project sound sometimes may issue go back producer ask improve time tell whether taste sometimes happen work take home think wow somehow listen home sound completely different different way hear different approach master need technically train ear think listen train golden ear example
gain intuition work recording think job regular basis much taste sure work project person quite important job everyday happen pretty fast come automatic instead listen music find path deal think time progress time taste master try help try take people give make little good taste

thank 2 part question electronic music mostly mean music certain trend sometimes evolve year maybe still now feel sometimes impact work kind trend popular minimal techno berlin micro house france impact work behind desk

master try think genre sure sometimes genre project work influence way work genre imply music play play club play home stereo intimate aggressive

thank

hope answer question

question couple

hello usually follow specific process work example start equalization multiband compression limit depend track need

pretty much depend project track need recording need process other need little process say first 2 last last step pretty clear last step will somehow limiter brickwall limiter everything happen depend record rule master work depend recording need
concept technical will artistic part technical aspect correct narrowband filter example denoising also part master come everything else record dc offset correct first continue artistic part call audio sweeten correction will

okay audio sweetener use use

master process use mainly two equalization compression two basic combination limit expansion depend project

okay artist send track usually give feedback start master tell need fix mix now usual

concept usually encounter problem serious problem find important correct letsay example instrument important instrument letsay snare drum example snare drum completely phase mean play back mono snare drum miss example ask electronic music club soundsystems mono even berghain soundsystem example weekend far mono impact sad artist miss snare drum go back tell hey phase may wanna correct

gonna bpm good



think

weight vinyl sometimes gram vinyl effect music press vinyl make difference thick vinyl

mean sound quality



doesn doesn myth gram gram doesnmake difference sound difference handle record feel

market



okay

make difference press plant ask virgin vinyl often press plant vinyl mixture recycle virgin vinyl make difference regard noise example

anyone else okay

hello hello insightful question master usually people concentrate low end high end usually midrange get bite forget work midrange usually go low end high end midrange work midrange apart

depend club music nowadays look frequency content analyzer look little bite bathtub huge low end much mid high end sound information midfrequencies important ear evolution much sensitive hear linear ear pretty sensitive frequency domain ear much little sensitive low high frequency
track huge low end little bite high end information mid will always sound low compare track information mid frequency content frequency balance track quite far either talk artist try apply process obvious eqing example sometimes mix parallel path frequency selective parallel path letsay information mid strong enough strong without obvious eq step quite high amount gain prefer example mix parallel path try raise level mid

question type eq approach recently dynamic eq use right now think add dynamic usual process work

dynamic eq basically similar multiband compression use prepare processor quite complicate different band band gain 2 knob quality q factor dynamic function threshold attack release quite complicate apply process less always try keep control control sit master master detail sound make easy good outcome go change order rid artifact complicate process multiband compression dynamic eqing quite steep learn curve

thank

letgive mike another round thank come
