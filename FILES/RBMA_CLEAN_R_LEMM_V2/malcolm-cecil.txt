milliohms put small difference people stevie
hear bring hold box little magic
box use make sure synthesizer always tune
joystick controller build remote control model
aircraft probably control drone day
joystick now first time joystick
use synthesizer putney use joystick joystick
hokey spring couldn anything
calibrate model aircraft controller
set brilliant technical ability look will
see joke simple circuit simply provide voltage
two separate voltage horizontal use control pitch
notice spring center demonstrate vertical
use control filter now two wrong moog
moog c upstairs three monophonic two
touch sensitive way dynamic walter carlos huge success switch bach much clockwork orange bach write instrument touch sensitive write harpsichord organ baroque music sound great synthesizer try play beethoven romantic period come little late try play type music now dynamic synthesizer moog doesn readily around also fact
play note chord half story keyboard half story tune two octave try get full keyboard upstairs tune way try change range difficult tricky tricky tricky re
constantly adjust come simple solution advantage
two little white side
see look back see actually
change physical position pot control
therefore sort zero alignment align
centre fly model s
fly straight adjust little horizontal use
pitch vertical use filter shut filter
analogue synthesizer will mute sound will take high
frequency make sound mute sort touch
control sort sensitivity certainly substitute
correct pitch little finger bass player be
use change filtration
little knob vertical now notice vertical stay
filter sound keep leave
also pitch bend knob set distance
pitch bend amount filter get s
three little knob simple switch change
polarity go simple enable
keep tonto tune even someone else play keyboard have
play little guy sit lap sit
console still control keep stevie tune
musician first foremost music idea help
aid stevie get whoever play wasn
get sound work use work piano
player saxophone player use play jazz turn
dime change different key change different
tempo change different mood use hard deal play little box secret tonto probably synthesizer early seem tune

talk year ago mean now
think welcome moog upstairs family talk
person fix certain german band pretty
popular electronic

have kraftwerk wouldn

oh sound beautiful nearly impossible tune think hard whether whether live start wonder especially time industry exist time illustration total sale thousand million whatever
total sale moog unit sell year per quarter show graph screen quarter four unit sell exactly much talk small numb people actually work environment now talk different hat
wear tinker piece technology
time buchla moog oberheim react moog tonto different kind talk

try talk manufacturer early day use come
sit crosslegged floor try tone
unit plug back keyboard see
two big blue ribbon connector back think two
pin connector big suppose go box
design make tune buy box
bring demonstrate come three four
time sit crosslegged floor solder iron resistor
whole stand try help
happen never never work
end tune c f tone couldn
way problem moog arp example next come attention arp use oberheim volt
per octave pitch another need analogue
synthesizer call trigger parlances gate
mean arp make distinction trigger single
pulse go come back gate turn stay
lift key difference trigger gate
arp notice difference peculiar moog
keyboard press key now release key
press another key will play two note note
play usually high two depend change
circuitry low play two
note select high low note furthermore moog
order envelope generator work now envelope name
imply package sound deliver word s
pattern envelope attack initial decay sustain
final decay release standard fourparameter envelope
inside turn voltage control amplifier fader
turn automatic fader control gain
output instrument
synthesis three stage first stage take rich waveform mean take waveform
harmonic oscillator good secret
bass sound tonto minimum three oscillator minimum sometimes
many depend tune
note also trick use call
rich waveform need lot lot harmonic way re
sound filter mean subtract s
call subtractive synthesis take rich waveform filter
pinch voltage control amplifier now
three process go note another order turn
note envelope start tell envelope
generator start now addition pitch send oscillator
send trigger gate signal envelope
generator say turn vca now envelope generator set
parameter go repeat parameter vca
change note start envelope generator envelopestarted along now change note change note without lift moog happen
envelope restart note change go sing
tune legato keep play eventually get decay
nothing whereas play individual note gate s
continuous retriggered lift note
push start now go sing
tune short articulation distinct sing either
retriggering big difference way play
new play synthesizer keyboard moog
keyboard note touch sensitive
tune two octave addition
play right wonsound right sound awful have
lift lift retrigger
think whole different way arp
decide come good idea every
time new note strike even gate start trigger go
retrigger envelope generator different type envelope
generator difference now require v whereas order
trigger moog require grind zero volt moogtrigger put
grind dangerous plug
envelope generator accidentally touch grind will trigger
come sound certainly dangerous live performance
wasn good idea go positive trigger arp go v
addition gate trigger every time
redo worry whether lift
trouble make everything sound samey every note
sing staccato rhythm note envelope
sort fix wasn perfect fix job now
arp keyboard play moog module moog keyboard play
arp module voltage problem transposable
put voltage pitch work
finally decide settle v trigger
good oberheim come synthesizer
expander module trigger v everybody different
ems trigger v different standard standardize within tonto come standard make instrument play nicely instrument

tell speak vibration little bite frequency
also feel emotion song past maybe two month friend get yoga deal meditation forget call recall life shape bowl little wooden piece similar term shape tap

sing bowl tibetan

tibetan emit vibration also frequency work intertwine
affect emotion mood focus meditate
question deal frequency frequency affect someonemood
term sound whatever study incorporate
song certain frequency evoke certain feel
someone listen song

think quite simple frequency frequency essentially pitch sound threedimensional object time okay tell language talk threedimensional object space threedimensional object space length height thickness three dimension independent real object three present less form even monomolecular film oil top water make dullish yellowy bluey rainbow rain see road monomolecular film oil molecule thick still thickness thickness wouldnexist real world length width now true sound sound threedimensional object time length
duration go sing ah duration length time
call length long note use term
height pitch low pitch high pitch medium pitch pitch vertical
whether low medium high note
3 thickness talk fat brassy sound
thin reedy sound okay tonal quality three together
create sound single sound sound many pitch
example talk envelope maybe change
voltage change envelope sound sing
series pitch numerous pitch still envelope
thickness height look music
complex sculpture individual note sound play note
many many different way sing note many different way
sing different tonal quality sing different
intensity many way vary always vary
three dimension either vary timbral quality re
vary pitch vary duration three manner
fashion think true say frequency
pitch will will evoke
certain feeling certain way example create
feel tension way play note t
sit together play note close together
nature harmonic nature frequency way work
way harmonic work go high scale
note produce will blend original hold
multiple original frequency look mathematically
letsay cycle low note bass note cycle
octave cycle octave double cycle
octave every octave twice much space
frequency way hear divide
proportionally way usually hear hear harmonic
easily although think intrinsic
every note everything harmonic structure whether
note harmonic structure determine
whether two note play together harmonic
structure call consonant
sound sweet within harmonic structure sound
dissonant sound sweet time ungh
movie score killer come s
shove knife shower curtain kill lady
shower happen alfred hitchcock movie listen
soundtrack semitone apart violin
semitone apart rub uncomfortable feel
yes feeling convey usually single frequency way
combine frequency chord voicings
take piano look harmonic series
harmonic series go actually take note time
frequency two three four five look octave
hundred two hundred nothing
two next harmonic next now
halfway two four quite middle
turn dominant note word original
note c 2 harmonic will c octave
g octave c 5 harmonic next e
now look c g e different octave now play c
e g bottom piano together sound mud
play c skip octave half play g skip next c play e
now play harmonic bottom note harmonic will
blend sound smooth will feel consonant will feel sweet
strong voice major chord c miss octave half g
e next octave strong powerful three note
put make major chord sound great much good c
e g anywhere piano play close people tend forget s
key understand relationship harmonic everything else
harmonic important dominate music
obey rule harmonic understand rule harmonic
use doesnmean everything harmonically perfect
everything conform harmonic series will sound sweet
conform tensive sound re
write film score helpful now tool able
tell make scene tense
come point get even tense
harmonic theory will guide important
aspect
publish book whole topic
ready little research life
anything leave behind
tonto course think will universally useful
wasnaround bear hopefully will kick
daisy end time know long now
enjoy good life now plan live three
year stretch way however philosophy change still
live three year live may true find much full life probably do do never set career path never future mind present build present past worth otherwise break make
whole new start do many time life now never fail
havenmade new start good lady
together year


unfortunately get cutthroat sign
curtain

run medium run medium

much harrass late maybe
erik little time studio around little moment
multitracks certain track maybe people
interest go may explanatory
still around whether possible

sure have happy track

probably main studio everyone bite
rest work guy maybe seven seven
work work timewise will let will
ring noise technicality aside go
song 2 give warm hand
welcome welcome goodbye probably welcome stage

mean welcome

please everybody join thank mr
