south korean government couple bear long interest may spark idea find guy call paul deveraux wellknown professor cambridge england style archeoacoustician
go round ancient burial site temple pyramid etc analysis
sound point view discover ireland
series burial mound call cairn despite fact dot
around country make different different
size lining different resonate particular
frequency predominant resonant frequency hz mimic sound koyaanisqatsi
now interest enough suggest
build enhance sound ritual burial combine
take psychoactive drug interpret room carve
inside etc notion idea ask
friend bunch student analyze feed different
frequency see happen brain mri scan
guess exactly hz switch prefrontal cortex brain
completely go trance obviously know year ago
particular frequency free drug put
space trance therefore social trance
everybody else space
pretty wild think
corollary friend mine oliver rothschild run various huge company around world particularly curzon group good man interest heal power sound anybodydone sound therapy havenlots view accept good practice
actually establish currently patent process
establish sound medicine use different frequency see
maybe heal different illness use different frequency
imagine drug company feel way
thrill free way charge have charge need tone generator find interest show happen past forget will rediscover time go
light note friend brian duffy call
modify toy orchestra pick
toy sorry yellow life normally yellow
shit okay basically pick toy car boot sale p
examine gut get chip examine chip construct modify chip attach new controller enable connect pa actually play live
instance see hula barbie actually shake hip
eye light pretty cool stick head actually capacitance controller make bizarre sound play back mimic barbie doll sing pretty cool different capacitance make make incredibly grany bite sound
another lesson basically say recycle hey
musical recycle use different instance tell mattel make chip information every toy every chip even although barbie doll unlock certain part
find toy build chip action man spiderman whatever coursespeakspells whatever five people play
live kraftwerk st century let whip round guy absolutely fantastic see

haven friend work completely obsess


unbelievably good musical get near end now
friend mine call sancho plan narrative design flash control animate character screen behind use percussion pad live performance
trigger sound trigger movement actual case
call space quatica actually cartoon sea creature have sound
pretty wild talk various people las vega
moment use technology create new type show
interest people actually place
sound field microphone have microphone place centre
time square dundas square transmit information anywhere else
world via internet except build
internet doesnwork anywhere else earth reproduce
reproduce anywhere scale wild think
reproduce sound time square trafalgar square instance art gallery ulan bator blow mind translocation
reality take away visual element bite time travel
completely wild
also talk people
different interface obviously deal new threedimensional world new interface talk guy two year now remember minority report way
move common move shit around guy gspeak actually design look now go
do real real move
around screen go actually go screen
membrane reality virtual world now break

actually create threedimensional world actually navigate screen use hand mouse nothing transmitter camera read spot special glove
pretty wild future touch screen space three dimension wow work future hold artistic educational installation theatrical imagine new form theatre musical theme park already
talk disney dreamworks
world premiere make big
splash people bob come us
work even good outdoor indoor
importantly collaboration visual interactive
technology everythinggetting cheap cheap cheap
webcams software control shit get cheap ultimately
aim
holodeck suppose star trek
enterprise far away excite
shut everybody hasn question

think definitely now time put floor

hello question guess maybe assume much approach
synthesis emulative respect sort instrument stevie wonder say

totally different stevie wonder may notice think
start point reason instrument evolve
last thousand year western instrument
world instrument reason normally base natural
harmonic occurrence etc shape instrument will hear certain
sound require human intervention
interest basic build block rather try make sound cor anglais interest
shit fact wasn interest walter carlos instance
start abstract experimental form
start switch bach think pretty
pointless
emulate real instrument excite bite
normal instrument analogue
equivalent right word analogous equivalent actually
stevie wonder quite interest example use band
call tontoexpanding head band try find anybody know look
limewire everything two guy academic
participant
youtube footage youtube

need footage need actual album put anybody know anyway guy go work stevie wonder instrumental thousand time interest musicallyorientated
stevie view
participant
monitor have sound want position speaker
mix many use

explain apologise software cope
speaker location minimum need cube flatten
cube need eight speaker minimum need four low
give space four high go numb
two ring tell software
relation centre space x y z coordinate
go two meter right three meter two meter back
every speaker press go create convolve virtual space create virtual space actually fly live
space know speaker
great studio brixton london six meter diameter octagonal doesn shape two ring eight speaker create mexico city installation completely different
shape speaker put new speaker location
automatically send right amount signal every speaker also play live cool
imagine sensor attach dancer instance ballet dancer interpret movement dance stage audience wild work royal ballet moment try sensor small
possible accurate possible quite difficult actually have
think easy several
lose line sight lose signal
say instance ballerina get hoist colleague
attach sound sound move audience
time pretty cool actually work
size auditorium indoor honest mexico city piece first time have do anything big have talk talk actually walk walk now sound
good think build right delay fade difference everything mindbendingly good

ask frequency cut
certain speaker air

use full range speaker find use
rather theory low frequency tend sound physically low space vice versa think historically cave man woman use ear survival
purpose bird prey come screech
hear difference evolutionary advantage
dude couldnhear anything
find instance
synthetic sound quite high pitch swoop people back head front give thrill use trick
manipulate wrong word talk
word positive manipulation isn wrong manipulate sound
mad scientist try give people
interest experience

start make think have see curious
listen level anxiety create
certain tone far study find certain frequency
affect certain actually interest find
frequency use

interest normally result harmony incidental tone
set tooth edge particular case even weird say hz physiological effect coincidentally someone send clip think american publication t
anything zoo worker find
machinery zoo compressor give certain frequency
analyze discover particular frequency drive crocodile mad drive elephant mad drive animal insane realize soon change fine
hz blow mind people send
also another blow mind discover pulsar recently late pulsar discover resonate particular frequency pretty wild mean idea say
erich von dÃ¤niken
shit fully understand
research go along sonic heal foundation talk look effect people negative side infrasound dude macho think use sound weapon

quick question spatialisation
past problem
dopplereffekt two speaker listen middle order think move across pan pitch go

yes software doppler build create completely realistic sound effect car come across sound find compositional purpose make
everything sound terrible soon move everything towards thecentre change pitch whilst wish use certain application normally switch
deal analogy physical world invisible dancer move around room invisible speaker move around
room also hey hear sound
hear wish fulfillment
directional speaker sound shit try
