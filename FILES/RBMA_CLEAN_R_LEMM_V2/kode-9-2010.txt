mission statement now label almost six year old feel
mission release good producer
genre simple mission statement

simple lecture yesterday conversation
fly lotus think common
among artist sound also s
applicable label although couldnsay hyperdub
label term genre definitely texture sound people will immediately whether record
fit

talk artist sign release last year cause quite diverse
kode
obviously famous burial

letgo first aware put
phenomenally successful
kode
scare wouldnsell mainly hadnput album new territory sell time take step forward tread tentatively ambition label burial
go surprise another surprise burial first artist release label wasn spaceape

many record sell
kode
first cd vinyl

inaudible question
kode


ballpark
kode
pause

put context us run label average specialist artist anticipate sell good day
kode
mostly sell ten year ago year ago joke honest drum n bass house techno triple quadruple big dance record people live record sale rare phenomenon underground music
day
fun different clearly happen rockindie resurgence idea faceless dance music slightly vogue day

think cycle come back round
kode
sure think still lose guitar

talk faceless explain little press producer sell first record bad look independent label need survive
kode
certainly help label survive mean care whether producer sell obviously great use business make aesthetic decision burial still
exception people try sound quite sound nobody level emotion pack track since burial spate people try faceless doesnwash seem bite contrive
unique burial
matter much cynicism anonymity seem create among people trust wasn market ploy na√Øve innocent desire spotlight know anything apart music question

remember record nominate mercury prize open sun newspaper sun uk tabloid high
circulation beyond paper page five burial
mission unmask burial whole time label manager get phone call tabloid newspaper
kode
pretty horrible actually track black sun actually come
burn copy sun newspaper annoy irritate
journalist write scottish particularly embarrass
burn kilt
guy want lead quiet life politician paris hilton someone actively seek attention paris hilton way case anyone think clue real identity strange think make recoil close rank make hide speak anyone speak press tell anyone anything secretive think healthy reaction

quite rare independent record label sale hostile bid people try sign guess character interest stay loyal anyway
kode
bother honest live get life
think approach backdoor myspace sniff couple people put shutter

play us burial anyone else label

nice little future hyperdub preview now say many
label headsdjsmusical visionary also phd write
book phd
kode
philosophy specifically philosophy warfare information
warfare philosophy physic cybernetics book
nothing music throw big pot
musical issue interest producer researcher


term sound though scientist whenever dj
people opportunity soundcheck choose record
think will good hear use pink noise white noise frequency
test science sound obviously important enough have
write book call sonic warfare sound effect ecology
fear
kode
never do soundcheck think must dubplate make load crackle soundchecks tend play track mostly dubplate tend sound round warm
usually use track dubplate
soundcheck cause system handle doesnput
midrange track amount space width sub usually
good record usually bad state pink
noise whitenoise black noise

sonic warfare
kode
book

thank steve term frequency obviously sonic
warfare test us military officially sure talk frequency psychological physical effect go book
particularly interest
kode
bookbasically politic frequency frequency
military context us army use acoustic weaponry iraq
israeli airforce lowflying

give us example military set people use
sound
kode
early example give book colonial period jamaica
tribe call maroon use horn call abeng
use communicate jungle secretly secretly
become apparent english colonialist become petrify
sound jungle home turf couple plan ambush basically early guerrilla warfare have camouflage
jungle film predator jungle come alive take british
interest example book book way certain frequency create fear uneasy listen
way soundused create bad vibe try
musician dj interest theoretically

ecology fear rather bass frequency
us psychologically
kode
yes bass example lot bass book good
example physicality sound whether hear feel vibration also lot highfrequency sound sound high hear still neural effect change way feel book sound
hear either low frequency high frequency

delve dog frequency affect turn
make music bad frequency
eliminate
kode
finish track anyway make difference s
natural people see connection book
music clearly different
person

must difficult though project deep book
gig saturday think keep
separate
kode
think healthy practice keep separate come
together have implode puff smoke disintegrate

long project take come together
kode
take long have contract take age three
four year contract two three year finish
book contract core idea werenmusical
develop phd hard job translate
soundrelated computer network warfare
guerrilla warfare information warfare

author label head dj lecturer
kode
teach music culturerelated film sound sound design university east london come today

find balance different hat wear long pause next music education argument say music
academic world intellectualise kill
unnecessary finding directly involve
academic music
kode
way see academia way see music crap good
good agree idea conceptualise
music kill vibe conceptualise badly maybe
badly book badly kill vibe
make bad music clear dance bad mix clear
dancefloorpause dog story worry

relate frequency think tell djing
festival
kode
sure relate

talk clear dancefloors frequency dj nightmare
kode
example people dancefloor clear play festival italy pescara think festival dominate trance music huge fascist rally trance tent sorry trance producer sorry actually play play tent priceless moment middle set
literally trance fascist
nextdoor tent black labrador walk middle
dancefloor festival beach black labrador probably
stroll ocean sit middle dancefloor stare us
bite stand take shit walk believe
idea certain frequency make go toilet

anyway maybe play another record story
top play another tune ask
question play
kode
say track finish recently
think finish yet do recently s
currently call skank may change
music kode skank
music kode uzi

okay question time question course break tradition
kode
mean

first time ask question actually hyperdub
many label last year start blog right
kode
wasn much blog miniweb magazine

okay miniweb magazine start post content
next step become successful label
kode
bite magazine label get bore
run magazine enough time interview
producer want interview get pretty bore oneyear self
employ career journalist have write website

release start happen become label
kode
friend mine kevin martin enthusiastic enough
track have work space ape call daddy gee
suppose part get bore try make people
music try sign another label get bore process
help us hook distribution everything else
bore get track master blah blah blah

probably right person ask hardcore
continuum
kode
right person ask tell anyway quite good
way describe certain evolution uk music hardcore drum
bass speed garage uk garage grime dubstep bassline house uk funky
sense america hiphop country hardcore continuum
participant
yes course boom bap tradition mean uk funky seem
come another place
kode
think come another place

sound different bpm different
kode
bpm dubstep grime jungle different
participant
course bass music guess uk funky socasounding
kode
long pause answer

interest touch come
gig probably venue never play try
work soundsystem process go
hope good
kode
scientific dubplate
bass particular record use hear lot different system
sound sometimes sound terrible start complain
politic frequency affect dj s
fight sound engineer club bass

say transdisciplinarian micro politic frequency
break orthodoxy phenomenology cultural study
doesnsound fight sound engineer
bite fancy way say
kode
fight sound engineer politic frequency work
dj nothing book hear record use soundsystem use usually doesnsound good try work sound engineer improve
system bass frequency sound muddy either wonhear lowend frequency hear wonfeel sound muddy system tune house use subhz frequency s
trial error always completely different s
consistent tend play record producer dubplates will test system system deal everything else okay

recommend make track low low lowend bass equipment monitor
kode
difficult particularly technical scientific bass frequency use high midrange bass sound filter kind crazy wobble use basic sinewave sub usually sort fight sub kick drum way deal sometimes win battle sometimes feel always lose
get lowend track isnrocket science ear preference certain technical good people tell certain bass note tend translate
resonance high frequency octave high
tend build track bottom start sub house build foundation construct top cave nothing technical have recommend people lowend
frequency difficult put music difficult
make space around lowend frequency keep sound flabby
muddy drown frequency nothing low
end
often sub high snare will drown even completely different frequency find music time snare go disappear swamp lowend obviously certain kick sub way interrelate sidechain kick come sub dip carve hole sub space kick question ask someone else

question twice oooh afraid participant time night time day thereof book buy around half hour now participant wish quick chat afterwards
kode
sure

set time tonight
kode
play back back till

track play us way
join say kode thank much indeed
