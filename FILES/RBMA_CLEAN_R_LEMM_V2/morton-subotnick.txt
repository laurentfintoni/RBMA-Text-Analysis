last touch open question video sue costabile dvd tomorrow night work lillevan see poland unsound recently strike fact werenfacing audience face screen visual guess
partly show amaze instrument

wasnfacing screen look screen face want buchla see actually play
wasn turn go actually play
think important less stage game give laptop
use ableton buchla go ableton oscillator get duplicate five six time different
oscillator five oscillator three oscillator multiply use sample get live

go back visual briefly lillevan
collaborative process

start describe way back use visual first
performance two vision large two thought future record medium record pure music listen take personally
individual personal even audience now course
pod ear live room forth

happen public performance record studio perfect come give someone else guarantee person give like good give listen forever
live room
live performance opposite live performance moment fail drama theatrical also feel begin

live performance visual component perform musical instrument see
performer play electronic see kinetic response imagine computer entire orchestra train beck call play every note mold
conductor
make decision time
composer perform sense spontaneous now gonna come way file play soft mean need go detail
feel begin kinetic visual component parallel piece somebody improvise know music will listen way
differently time go visual kinetic vocabulary counterpart stick chin
since work tony martin long time still occasionally find lillevan bring commission opus visual
idea
produce real work finally jacobroom play bregenzer austria dresden berlin vienna last year warsaw autumn september lillevan live video meet begin work together

visual appeal much

wasn much content visual though much way work make kinetic decision basis make musical decision deal increase energy fast slow see sue costabile use bar fluctuate work much isn quite mind electric circus pulse music
interpret kinetic energy music kinetic visual energy parallel direct look sue happy work always try little complex now performance new york together
expand vocabulary quite bite now close
lillevan point look different

letopen question audience wait microphone have wonderful

interest say early talk primitive
experience technology wonder mean join two world primitive electronic
difference two

let take first part mean primitive say first part

say primitive experience technology

remember say sure depend say two form primitive experience think urexperience primal experience re
start scratch hard
much nobody think way people sing happy birthday together go together sing note
shape primitive sing gesture shape
doesnmatter particularly whether c have e
understand human being animal give music oh unless sing right note musical keyboard try avoid go sing go c g
c csharp register
way have
sound without worry pitch now ear train way end c g mean keyboard stick whatever tune point get gesture inside find way express think mean primitive now part question

ask another question silence mean important role music create

silence say right way mean john cage mean different way think actually never conversation
always assume mean differently silence part fabric ask long note last actually ask
begin end
say rhythm time
note tatatata actually quarter note long start silence silence designator
anticipation next sound next sound go dahdahdah groan part dimension
time sound time
go daadaadaa different dahdahdah work silence john think
talk aspect talk timbre world sound talk musical silence deal

use silence quite dramatically wild bull example

yes pulse matter personal intention question ask loud go give
listen long silence little restless people

question regard music visual presentation watch horror movie listen soundtrack hear borrow texture mood music especially first piece silver apple prickly
ever think
want create sense unease listener feel use create sense unease

answer think wasnaware horror movie sound music

definitely borrow

use letter late say see strange green creature come bedroom listen
silver apple mind have answer question mind mean mind rest problem use however use
remember correctly wealthy
man new york proud fact play silver apple moon every halloween house scare people
point macyused halloween display must
effect people never intend doesn message
jeanpaul sartre say essay music doesnmean anything meaningful
draw meaning meaningfulness everybody differently nice

interest technological part control part big deal lose black white keyboard see technology nowadays control example buchla see opportunity use new technology touch response

use voice envelope follower use touchplate keyboard good now design period use reason use touch much control fingertip much extension emotion lot voice
much nose toe experiment use space even gentle hand flutter hand slightly
come fingertip touch real extension
picture somewhere website sensor glass heat sensor look close eye
anyone close eye little heat reflection light white eyeball actually measure relative movement use controller point none control voice fingertip wide open put sensor body brain control brain heart rate heart move fast use tongue
depend wanna extension
answer urquality inside energy
behind music turn sound far two
find meaningful finger pressure placement finger black white keyboard doesn voice

curious come san francisco everyonehigh
lazy casual new york little
aggressive music change influence

probably intend probably answer sometimes wonder happen stay san francisco wonder happen flop
go lawrence kansas probably wouldn right now

new music excite

recent music

peoplemusic modern

listen ask say think way t
categorize categorize fact learn judge hear first time destine go back listen see little
tell recent music like much messiaen develop aesthetic discover
aesthetic late begin give name ecstatic moment music tend attract

live performance tomorrow use gonna prepare set gonna freestyle

combination use buchla live move
ableton sample everything spontaneous decision happen happen set resource patch analog synthesizer computer
limit have
choose performance sample although change pitch time bring whenever
even pulse send get pulse oscillator
take sample play pass
oscillator buchla get pulse instead play normal form
array set available material
play lately performance last four week many city bag trick try much new time go

wonder practice practice practice technique way traditional instrumentalist

practice way instrumentalist
develop new technique particular good gonna use gradually move performance never play minute begin end
never long show go practice try little part go back build new technique be

rid everything learn gonna
come new procedure practice use clarinet gonna end performance may record point

welldeveloped philosophy sound music use
word awe ecstatic peer la monte young develop spiritual philosophy go sound music also



thank

allergy salute officer religion go
restaurant stop marvel tree hang tail now actually sit table howl moon scream
coo somehow make eroica symphony line
awe human natural evolution
much spirituality awe experience tell truth still crazy people run world manage sit talk amaze lethope keep

mention early use sample talk visual element assign certain visual certain sound use sampler conjunction visual processor
think concept
sound associate image clip audio visual
always two separately develop idea

think color organ scriabin personally oppose lock
perfectly happy someone else think gesturally think timbre result gesture pure
make mad sound dimensional aah
ooh combination color object particular sound sound produce
produce need color
say grunt hold hand voice respond emotionally way go grunt groan mean different voice almost
think color amplify give dimension experience use color

root sound color sound visual

sound sound expression underneath also do visual
visual parallel aspect hear
happen add musical experience whether dance whatever begin develop large context people build context sound particular theatrical situation
music communicate use anything addition music go beyond public arena use visual composite experience will bring context individual need bring

tell exactly say listen watch say context understand necessary message make
sense

thank much morton
