remember first record work

remember happen back people preference call choose work several different engineer call cod client people come street want record master care start type record time progress make name clientele

genre pretty much whatever person want

type music type everything

guess walk us process change much change back now fundamental concept little

technology say anything technology doesnstand still first start masterdisk probably music come quarterinch tape either ips ips ips stand inch per 2 year late become halfinch halfinch tape halfinch tape age come f beta vhs tape involve openreel come play year late cd come play change quite bite since now kind computer play term people record mix music onto

technology obviously change far approach change back

say early feel master ice cake project anybody take give wanna try make little good room

constitute good sound goodsounding record estimation

think important everything clean basswise bass tight punchy muddy tubby speak top end open airy mid range nice crisp also truth record create equal sound good other sure bad engineer go somebody come tape doesnsound good tell make sound good sound record market

people come tell

make sound dr dre record make sound jayz record easy easy

say polish

little say polish turd doesncome sound somewhere ballpark ain doesnwork

play anything far cite example describe sound maybe play will demonstrate little clearly

people ask format master still prefer halfinch ips dynamic open love age always costsufficient people come dats cd computer file simple cheap bestsounding record feel still do halfinch new technology expensive people arenusing oneinch tape lucky enough work kelly pricelast album first record master oneinch tape incredible incredibly dynamic incredibly clean eq record much somehow find amaze couple diffeent little play let feel dynamic jayz record master halfinch ips noisereduction tape play piece cut let see dynamic
music jayz change game

bob head beat love bass love sorry help see nod bite throughout session matter jazz rb whatever love bass bass sound

else say particular track example find ideal

love dynamic range low octave bass yet still top end good record mix master job

now bring though already sound decent say say sort maximize already play anything else
music jayz wanna love u give
music jayz excuse miss

back day back early forth go letsay album come halfinch tape normally do engineer studio perhaps producer consistent across board day album track seven different producer do ten different studio across country make little bite challenge consistent across board say mix create equal seem big challenge day master engineer try project bite consistent track track

severe sort example real disparate sound record maybe remember

addition engineer good other studio good other may boost track couple db top end next track may boost four db keep synch challenge sure definitely think music consistent studio format engineer speak

hiphop era concern seem hiphop album example live instrumentation also severe sort issue deal

run problem people ask come track doesnsound good track track isnmixed track track mix good studio sometimes people understand r people record company people understand job make happen hell little consistent

person come work always producer artist person

four normally somebody record company come sometimes engineer project will come make sure right sometimes artist come producer will come wide range different people sometimes room ten different people everybody want good project

sure love ten different people

easy everybody want sound right okay common difficult sometimes think try please ten different people sometimes impossible nine people happy way track sound person say bell loud little crazy time part make good

hand experience far producer whoever artist work

wow funny probably name quite guy start session end much hand involve everything tellin make suggestion reggie noble another premier reggie noble come five six morning unfortunately master record reggie run street real quick get sound effect skit

reggie noble know public

redman

say consistent guy come certain way

definitely hiphop bass bang tight loud punchy hear jayz play let play example doesnsound good diss person
music jayz mind right mami

now play big record come sound good doesnsound good vibe little taste jayz record sound play record sell million copy unite state come sound good see difference diss person find probably never work record big record say sell million copy forth listen music sound win vibe jayz record
music kid rock cowboy

long go try place satisfy

have say normally eq track happy people room happy have say listen three five time course eq record sound good take little bite long long session take time

now session standard obviously come bother million record purchaser client say cool

happy mean eq people room play beforehand play eq right people andy karp come r guy lava record have say have play record flat output console eq hear difference right happy record mean see long ago talkin guy put bass record forth smile wasnquite way like sound course record arencreated equal try master every record sound jayz record

notice rap little bite good jayz album do

hear say

couldn help aspect record

nah involve speak people

far hiphop go professional industry let ask first career predate hiphop somewhat far now bring different table hear different ear work hiphop record oppose genre

funny back start equalize record master record forth rock roll time heavy metal point jazz happen name record sell copy everybody want part back first album la bamba soundtrack audience totally different year start das efx redmans course record sell people gravitate want part engineer hate categorize put mode type music honest will probably surprise home relaxin chillin listen group call fourplay love music album daughter constantly say dad listen fourplay say baby eight album music listen audience love type music listen reflection mood go listen fourplay album yes little dr dre whatever depend mood

far standard hiphop sound different bring different work another genre approach exact way

approach music different regardless type take people give record mix session try make sound little good long time bring certain amount experience table instantly play back room go uh need little boost top end start work notice bass need big boost immediately attack different approach type music another

say record create equal producer hiphop particularly know grimy sound somebody wutang rza people experience work

do record early absolutely right griminess

play record club obvious sonic difference play record

definitely right do purpose engineerequipment use rza wutang clan record definitely bite grimy nice tight punchy bass love much people feel sound style tell do purpose sure way turn think hear kid rock record versus jayz think everybody want sound record sound good possible nice tight punchy bass nice open top end crisp mid doesnalways happen way unfortunately

work rap people different challenge far etiquette go sometimes probably elaborate couple example name name particular example particularly egregious come think gonna professional prepare maybe turn way

guess first obvious deal guess happen hiphop music people time normally start day o clock quite people show three four o clock rough term life plan afterwards business say day normally start o clock lucky end eight ten o clock many instance three four five o clock morning remember early day work maybe work try rush little bite work rush go play pool phone make phone call learn make plan work take song time

people particularly memorable far studio jayz ever show master session mean follow artist far process pretty much delegate responsibility point

depend individual think work last five jayz record first time meet work first dmx album come say hello show little support five album do come last suppose retire business come guess make sure okay

good show retire otherwise may never see right

exactly normally depend somebody job do whether r person engineer producer forth different everybody sometimes artist will come oversee project always depend record company person almost always

good bad

mind work people creative atmosphere problem nice room check website comfortable masterdisk fee clientele pool table conference room table computer try make comfortable people easygoing guy make record sound good possibly

now far length session go time say yesterday specific preference probably make sense far start day elaborate little bite

definitely wanna master record four o clock morning human us human being tire simple guy mix record time put gun studio hour job do mix normally turn good guy plan mix record try cause happen human being top end disappear turn next day back project wonder hell bright possible say stay away four o clock five o clock morning crap find within eight hour enough ten hour enough little burn easy tell say time gun record company putting pressure do do record put tomorrow noon end say time mix turn

put situation keep ear fresh

drink water may walk away take break definitely monitor loudly people feel turn crazy loud test speaker amplifier make little bite tire human being machine machine go day night human time last hour session putting record together make copy even studio redman six morning last hour fact say putting record together make copy back day tell project come halfinch quarterinch reel tape studio engineer use able master album four hour back day day case use also anywhere eight cut album day cut forth album therefore album tend go eight hour forth definitely change game regard say fact tape come studio across land different producer make session go long also

raise hand urgently

give example loud monitor play sound say

different set back studio three different type speaker nice genelecs sit console right couple foot big system back room nice small krk monitor nice people sit couch now course session bounce around three certain people come gonna turn music accept always turn way nothing eq play normal listen level soemthing
music kid rock devil without cause

wonder since get finish mix vocal arenloud enough will request give another mix vocal loud will eq little bite different

master even able boost mid top end bass vocal somewhat real sticky area letsay vocal level two db low make two db level eqwise good engineer will cover ass speak master tape give vocal version normally db even smart couple different one take little bite time little time print vocal db vocal two db go back redo time permit definitely suggest vocal level go db two cover

say early people masterdisk master house try go cheap way technology afford easy way drawback people

have say music work use analog console old neumann analog console whole different equalizer compressor people day master record pro tool machine master menu do test remember engineer richard keller come dmx album master console first console go back master pro tool machine warmth analog console pro tool machine computer people day tell think still new guess whole pro tool master machine pretty incredible help close studio throughout land unfortunately ten grand buy machine mix console record everything unfortunately good studio new york california probably everywhere close machine master menu still feel way go level us achieve console recently people call tell open master suite use pro tool rig guy say guess engineer understand sound good record hmmm big buck guess say spend money record master right level difference year pro tool rig around long have say matter choose whether record mix master think important spend time perfect craft good overnight ego degree take time take time good say homework put time level excellence matter choose

think inevitably technology gonna improve give warmth pro tool technology

wouldn surprise realize year technology doesnstop consumer end professional end always come consumer end money remember use vinyl cassette buy first cd player remember minidisc come compact cassette kind consumer end always try money now highdefinition cd everything else professional end pick mix magazine month month feel sorry studio owner always another pair speaker always another amplifier another mic try sell make whole record process good think year come mean pro tool rig come long way first come first come choice choose machine choose sonic solution use hard disk edit system george lucas star war fame invent video use music hasnkept technology pro tool rig surpass wouldn surprise year come software get good machine will perhaps take master studio

make feel personal level direct thread

say stop technology day win master record anymore problem long pay mean yes buy volkswagen buy mercedes car truth person call ask pro tool rig master make record sound good difference definitely difference still prefer analog console invest time master pro tool rig point less

talk little bite fatigue ear fatigue anything keep ear specifically protect besides studio listen music spare time

way miss think grow young man teenager think listen enjoy music now live may turn radio hour drive work hour drive home listen music spare time much use miss sometimes miss sometimes need little break guess play music loud loud time play easy listen level think make big difference say listen music loud sometimes see crazy guy drive highway nod head jam crazy crank time definitely go concert club tend stay away speaker definitely turn loud back damage ear speak

say try listen critical ear far aesthetic go must time sit work stand song stand artist challenge try overcome try make sound good

think professional professional think point two bring record master right bat say listen offensive although yearold daughter sometimes deal rap anything little tire hear bitch hoe ass fuck shit nigger time get little monotonous country call free speech deal think regardless professional year ago use heavy metal choice music listen home relax professional

always visual stereotype engineer white guy ponytail facial hair true stereotype experience fiction feel break boundary time work masterdisk come

probably still people come black mtv people surprise website picture mtv talk music great album panel vote talk nine inch nail record alot people surprise two africanamerican engineer feel make impact music business guess normal black engineer master record hopefully year come change

describe importance anybody buy dance record early guy name pretty much everything significant talk little bite impact

consider friend many year ago deliver package throughout different record studio new york run control room master suite frankford wayne wow inspire go forth now feel wow brother feasible possible first start masterdisk aspiration master remember see herb definitely bite inspiration go forth perhaps take advantage situation give see quite bite difference still business black mix record engineer use first start say use ponytail grub face true anymore beautiful feel music hear people say may cliché music universal language feel way listen music go oh black white asian anything else music speak us across board part country love much little different grow grow type relationship girlfriend record speak relate still record now impact affect people whether boyfriendgirlfriend life love music much always touch reach soul

say first hit record la bamba soundtrack actually compilation los lobos approach master compilation simply different studio also different artist different sound

different genre maybe even

even back remember right long time ago come source studio different artist track different approach cut cut feel large percentage

create homogenous sound time respect individuality single artist

correct say think large portion already do actual record actual mix work already do say putting ice cake try keep consistent possible listen feel need do whether boost top bass whatever easy day say project cut do do ten different studio different producer try keep consistent possible across board easy probably easy say

ever ambition record engineer produce

sometimes wish involve mix hang different studio watch record put together crazy crazy right word think crazy creative point mean combine track onto leave right channel creative say two third already do putting little glaze ice sometimes wish mix cause think creative far produce think start little old venture now think even mix sense end home wife daughter already work ten hour day try work weekend involve mix sure never home end perhaps ruffle feather people work

whole concept remaster experience mean sometimes hear reissue classic album say remaster blah blah blah sometimes difference sometimes sound negligible experience

think technology come play think record day crazy crazy loud much loud different type equipment available everything else think company reissue remaster perhaps do back bring sync todaysound loudness people put record day think time destroy dynamicness record play jazz record master will never make record loud perhaps hiphop record hiphop guy record sound loud next next next line lose bite dynamicness music client want lose play jazz do recently find open dynamic please squash record make sound loud think mess lose people feel way catch client want make happy

hear hiphop remaster record ten year ago nas illmatic supposedly remaster hear ever compare

say work listen music car home try good critical judgmental play either enjoy vibe cause start start listen music ooh doesnsound good ooh need top end whatever home try good say buy reissue remaster say

play another example maybe jazz piece give us another audio example talk

okay love play guy hear play jayzdynasty album play kid rock record mix halfinch ips love format ask prefer master play use new technology sure gentlemanname somebody invent oneinch machine
music kelly price unknown
sticky situation think certain person master record cut vinyl explain say hopefully work give deal sometimes happen people woncut vinyl broke somebody else wonder doesnsound right talk halfinch analog tape machine key sound good align take care true cut piece vinyl high frequency alignment total alignment need do machine do right tell turn use every right ask use cut vinyl everything else important sure studio masterdisk new york studio offer break people day have surprise say call place explain situation list engineer master guy every right spend money request engineer b c have somebody want work wonpass somebody else accommodate client good care jayz guy start understand people start want go give type respect care big budget people think fair

thank much see new york

welcome

wonder run difference master vinyl bass side phase bass people realize difference explain

oh problem necessarily change eq cd versus vinyl find letsay five track album put vinyl letsay 5 track topend high frequency cymbal fun vinyl problem innerband distortion doesnexist cd cd make crazy loud type top end without problem

innerband distortion

come vinyl deal problem

laymanterms

towards centre record top end possibly distort high level

three track close label will distort top end

possible another people understand vinyl guy dj goodsounding piece vinyl will neighborhood ten maybe minute vinl minute drop level happen play record minute versus minute minute will probably sound good people understand ask physic long record room take piece vinyl

play old vinyl copy fear black planet sound shitty

chance odd minute care cut piece vinyl way odd piece vinyl sound good ten minute doesnwork way issue try keep vinyl ten minute minute understand sound good back day cd weren play use cut vinyl perhaps minute let people sound good piece vinyl nowadays combat master album minute long instead cut make two piece vinyl record company make four piece vinyl way piece vinyl minute long sound good minute long

expense imagine

true cost four piece vinyl versus two everything sound quality important consider another different sometimes engineer cut vinyl understand talk phase bass phase vinyl cut engineer real problem time happen machine cut groove phase bass groove go deep thin deep thin gesticulate arm indicate thin much good chance record skip possible maybe create two different mix make phase crazy cd problem problem come vinyl cut problem say groove get thick thin thick thin sometimes project happen go oh cut vinyl deal little trick around sometimes

pj say someone give honest assessment say maybe bring master bring tape whatever much master process actually go back provide else dc guy part world able come masterdisk call phone pretty expensive call advice give resource feedback

always try professional never come tell anybody mix piece shit think fair right day age people love compare record another record time record tend sound whole good record sound time fair say car create equal yes volkswagen mercedes car true mix sometimes master wrong say make difference record perhaps will play radio win take step process record mix master try good engineer shortcut say mix aingood fix master drive us crazy sometimes doesnwork way amongst bestsounding record three step do possible bring crappysounding mix leave master somehow turn good record world doesnwork

folklore profession say oh man come sound perform miracle example

happen say master make world difference wrong convince master make hit think call hit make make record write make record track studio make end record company whole team people get ass promote record make happen hear mass

ask much term commercial success recognition much craftsmanship level within profession hear come sound crap tony tight now sort story example

top head say year sure case peoplerecords perhaps sound great come sound world good leave master facility sure happen quite bite good master engineer give prop big bass brian call la way record sound

work

oh work kind dr dre whether eminem dre cd changer now car enough album black eye pea love record ask record love record sound love quite music listen name perhaps big bass brian guy ever meet guy have definitely give prop love way record sound

crisp

way big bass tight nice openair sound think good engineer

touch briefly rza people make intentionally grimy try objective hear genre music producer grime deal suppose sound grimy bad way sound grimy oppose good way sound grimy

feel strongly term master large percentage work do get people spend time record record spend time mix certain way go project want change ego kick change record sound accept fact record mix record certain way reason try make little bite good possible say sometimes people purpose mean diss kid rock early record perhaps want sound way sound good normally tend record sound speak engineer probably purpose

question point

ten question try keep short two say think kid rock record maybe fact use live instrumentation way approach make record different way have program mpc sp

say do detroit engineer probably kill people work record say whole good engineer get good equipment use say go engineerrealm world say important aspect good engineer listen back listen speaker lie way world end good mix hear isn correct phase game think important overlook decent speaker honest truthful listen environment isncorrect almost impossible good mix eqing change isn true may end sound good go car home wonder happen speaker situation listen environment important matter whether record mix master important

say give true sound mean industry standard yamaha ns speaker tannoy

aaarrrggghh nss curse make sign cross

uk engineer tend mix nss studio tannoy speaker

truth nss popular speaker damn near every studio stand speaker sorry room confuse listen hell listen key guy good speaker say little ago part craft good learn good equipment engineer mix nss understand therefore come good mix guy doesn nss put bass unless good find guy turn bass come place masterdisk oh god much bass engineer wasnfamiliar speaker turn hear knock nss speaker every darn studio throughout country popular

last question quickly talk pro tool master software problem mix record cause work engineer right now state keep run mix pro tool software master expect go master someone plan go speak session problem master pro tool come master analog situation

think mix engineer mix engineer leave master guy master record regular basis happen day say engineer will bite premastering speak end find headroom tape slam term loud crunchy sound compress make loud end headroom creative real problem day tell mix guy mix good let master go master guy

people problem people realize run pro tool master bring someone problem

engineer work ruff ryders little premastering give guy listen come say use sound file do let go ahead master knock anybody want go route say pro tool master compare let see six room place engineer tend use analog console pro tool realm have say let mix guy mix guy tell master pro tool machine less

okay thank

anybody else right now okay

want ask mix especially mix mean print vinyl safe low frequency use example kick drum cut hz hz low frequency vinyl cut make skip without use phase mono bass

lowfrequency bass doesnnecessarily cause skip listen classical music guy train classical music day record cannon shot kind go way way low bass nothing wrong tell cut hz hz anything creative fun vinyl type low frequency bass phase end problem

go low

go low creative fun

often less us send cd print vinyl back see sharp cut low frequency maybe pop effect whatever get back vinyl advice mean mix especially vinyl advise mix engineer mix vinyl except bass phase advice

say cut vinyl eq different vinyl cd explain early time may problem inner band piece vinyl top end innerband distortion basswise phase sometimes will run across instrument will cause skip forth case master guy may cut little bite point speak everybody wouldnsay limit creative fun type problem master guy let

okay another question mix master good analog board cd bite format preferable prefer file datum cd file print bite resolution export mix environment whatever much range use dynamic range file much use give slam peak level

crunch mix hit hard almost distort talk early doesngive us headroom creative already slam pin meter master guy make loud plenty loud

leave two db tolerance maximum

even leave leave little bite say master guy make crazy loud desire day age use find world close feel analog bite dats cd sound pretty darn amaze pretty impress difference audio cd computer datum file personally use converter play back converter use call dcs guy masterdisk goodsounding whether audio cd cd file play back converter doesnmatter choice bite have say bite may cost little bite us rend machine play back charge little extra worth soundwise feel

anybody else

say important produce music good speaker sound wouldncheat listen back speaker set speaker advise use lowbudget producer

another mix magazine every month hundred hundred speaker type budget personally small genelecs near console tell model exactly five year come subwoofer amplifier incredible

website

sure small one also use krk monitor first generation seven series probably sell couple hundred unfortunately good product market different manufacturer tend make good krk go crazy year formica side make krok triangle crazy first generation one call series think phenomenal speaker good way judge monitor play back material familiar mix perhaps old record cd familiar always like way sound play back speaker good way test tell decent familiar mix familiar tell need favorite record love year say check speaker big system room use year hartley sub woofer altec middle customize tweeters top system old want new afraid change simply make live know type speaker sound finally guy call francis manzelle come along speaker call griffin monitor oldschool ribbon tweeter big subwoofer incrediblesounding speaker unfortunate part cost much little car set room friday three day row come whole big bag cd familiar record know like master play music back three day play back give input like end buy speaker rid old one now say big use system use system probably year familiar comfortable new speaker system make sure buy suit play back nearly cd listen every skip certain cut listen make sure want like say speaker lie way expect mix do right way important use monitor sure

keep mind tony go studio break work guy do will opportunity ask question

tell us normal day ten hour hour hear ear tire tell

four o clock morning enough point come eqing record say start day personally o clock o clock start album session whatever now spend ten hour eqing record problem eight ten hour sometimes little bite good day rest last hour day sequence record make copy even tend go three four o clock session morning last hour sequence equalization anymore mean everybodydifferent learn limit definitely situation mix wee hour morning simply check mix next day find perhaps darn bright ear woah probably okay

important certain amount sleep important

get old now use able alright five hour sleep fine function okay get old now find need sleep little bite live perfect world sometimes way function right hour two sleep human being gotta remember machine

think everybody room understand now last ever enforce rule make sure go beyond four morning

ha ha ha yes

turn

time year think work much know cranky cranky snap people everything else remember work record mix timbaland two hour late session have already equalize record make copy call request snap now wasngood probably lose client havenworked although do mix timbaland havenworked since start snap cranky people overwork much tell people front office look work much remember stretch work six morning three day row know probably wasn good tell front office look need day away start lose snap timbaland know lose cool cool time music business especially deadline always behind always do now do now will time body function push edge back point year work late much unfortunately two four hour people show late decide impose rule work past midnight fee go hour now yes ridiculous amount money make money encourage people late show time job do people give shit nothing charge rate keep try combat case work people oh midnight good good

alright
