basically let explain little bite machine little bite history leave side see actual synthesizer modular synthesizer synthesizer plan distribute magazine call formant german magazine modular synthesizer electronic music big midbeards synthesizer
basically subscribe magazine subscriber detail plan front panel solder module modular synthesizer make different module different case wasn wasnold enough time find vienna actually twice big do badly previous owner must young eager time buy sit studio year year work rarely use
point decide give try make small select module work take whole apart whole clean print solder whole together still rough piece comparable moog modular system arp rough special modular synthesizer make little bite special
everything see right side relatively new still build today top analog sequencer step sequencer may doepfer sequencer also sequencer also software also emulation step sequencer build guy germany call munich use equipment kraftwerk sequencer couple year now think stop now basically still around available
filter bank basically control extra output synthesizer custommade fit configuration basically inputoutput mixer sum signal output stylish vu meter actually nice sometimes play come look come actually useful back synthesizer case point leave side module four vcos vco voltage control oscillator question point say vco

vco

oscillator basically make waveform order hear different waveform select square wave sine wave sawtooth four oscillator two filter come 2 configuration synthesizer split middle output side synthesizer point leave side synth module output side synthesizer point rightside synth module also two vu meter letstart easy vco basically vco generate wave press trigger fire oscillator demonstrate sound demonstrate trigger waveform part demonstrate sound press envelope follower change waveform say select various waveform mix course example sine wave demonstrate sound square wave example contrary demonstrate sound various kind sawtooth demonstrate sound alone make tone tune adjust certain bandwidth square wave demonstrate sound basically vco little advance pretty simple pretty simple course mix different waveform letsay deep nice bass certain crunch demonstrate sound mix two waveform clear question oscillator

think oscillator waveform seem switch five time

oscillator generate waveform time case possibility actually bite easy make sound

four oscillator produce simultaneously five different waveform time sound mean waveform time

yes course

knob mix

switch switch say actually four oscillator select waveform mix together mix amount four oscillator mix amount waveform oscillator quite cheap solution actually good waveform per oscillator
okay basically four see envelope point top leave side synth module mean trigger demonstrate sound oscillator create certain way sound will go attack decay sustain release mean attack mean long will take sound will actually come first moment trigger long will take oscillator will play put demonstrate sound little plop decay mean long will sound sustain mean long will hold reach high position release mean long will go away knob demonstrate sound four control basically shape way sound come put long release long attack demonstrate sound inaudible question case envelope oscillator envelope little bite advance system

envelope

envelope explain mean sound shape show attack demonstrate sound decay amount time sound will take reach high amplitude demonstrate sound sustain mean long will stay release mean long will sound push button basically work part part 2 envelope work filter bring us subject filter think will go sequencer run inaudible question yes machine old analog synthesizer control control voltage cvgate control voltage mean time midi everybody remember time midi even time midi way put keyboard tell oscillator play press key
find apply little voltage think volt different machine different system press key send little signal synthesizer tell actually sound will play high will play cvgate system cv tell high play give value zero volt trigger say event take place two cable cv green gate sequencer output tell tone play trigger output tell tone will play
will start now will move along start sequence oscillator hear twiddle filter button basically finger knob point envelope follower button sequencer three row sequencer first row give pitch note adjust knob
sorry little problem sequencer little rush today morning couldn prepare restart sequence okay will fix now good basically trigger note see adjust envelope make short sound make long sound now oscillator side accompany 2 oscillator mix two together change sequencer sound basically two voice play together side find nice way sound together point leave side synthesizer waveform send filter
electronic music probably important important invention probably filter make actually sound interest make sound cool modulate probably turn knob frequency turn knob filter happen side turn filter knob
certain type filter lowpass filter mean everything low will pass everything high will cut away mean move along demonstrate filter knob check much amount high frequency much low bandpass filter give ability cut everything away highpass filter basically high frequency basically three part course also mix demonstrate
filter apply modulation mean see lfo also oscillator four oscillator hear oscillator mean hear audible modulation tool show display lfo actually frequency somebody see point screen little red light actually frequency oscillator produce couple different waveform case switch mean hear modulation various easy way demonstrate putting filter
knob assign cable lfo run modulate filter lfo demonstrate see frequency will modulate filter also oscillator will affect frequency oscillatordemonstrates together demonstrate frequency stay modulate demonstrate
actually do different input take lfo put filter take lfo put oscillator manipulate without basically oscillator filter envelope shape sound play different kind modulation example different kind lfos also modulation ring modulator mean basically take oscillator mix two oscillator together fee back filter actually demonstrate
sorry sequence sound extremely annoy come moment twiddle knob demonstrate ring modulation hear now mix two frequency together put ring modulation mean frequency also affect frequency another modulation possibility

sound two different frequency example two different note put ring modulation alter keep difference sound alter understand

right take two frequency whatever also frequency audio signal side mix together grab ring modulator another external input put example beat voice whatever mix together waveform

pretty much mix wouldn say drum two may sound come different place put make sound

much mixer mix together modulation frequency oscillator will affect way audio signal sound will mix frequency together maybe show white noise take frequency twiddle knob demonstrate now hear noise together frequency oscillator random noise twiddle knob demonstrate take another frequency will sound totally different
okay let explain sequencer quick point right side two main module basically sequencer step sequencer mean event event bar letput way first easy situation moment actually time scale synchronize sequencer drum machine basically press play drum machine idea actually bar count two three four two three four start first step sequencer easy way play simple step sequence twiddle knob demonstrate
now see every step note put middle doesnlight simply doesnplay note okay simple moment trigger oscillator length tone do say now okay nice melody will put step button sequencer start look note point top row sequencer basically work keyboard say note will next twiddle knob demonstrate next twiddle knob demonstrate
basically play keyboard fast machine cancel couple note make little funky part point 2 row sequencer stop sound turn knob two three four five six basically octave turn knob time around go c next c row transpose option point rocker switch mean transpose every single note note play moment
use full octave point top row sequencer use octave octave already three octave hand probably use let restart sequence transposition also decide high go now go six note go full octave transpose full octave note actually work course basically play three octave row point top row sequencer
pitch actually make overall pitch adjustment transpose whole line demonstrate everything work follow put now use now 2 line sequencer basically line freeassignable basically follow path little different top row sequencer go note note note 2 top row sequencer free middle section go example show filter also line 2 question meantime sequencer first putting note

question connect drum machine

midi clock midi midi basically drum machine start sequencer master clock midi clock drum machine send clock signal whenever start machine sequencer run time basically feature every machine inaudible question sequencer basically midi master midi also slave another normally work computer studio drum machine slave sequencer much easy change tempo drum machine change tempo sequencer see work away little knob cool sequencer follow master clock studio obviously

midi channel assign example first channel trigger trigger press play

right now explain use oldschool way cvgate mean gate tell exactly event happen cv actually tell happen note oscillator play basically two control also possible control midi keyboard sequencer little difficult midi show actually happen cvgate much graphic show module work
example control 2 row sequencer possibility control filter within groove track follow step top row sequencer take control voltage sequencer remember put lfo early filter sound demonstrate basically filter little red light open close filter time nice sometimes polyrhythmic feel
time rhythm actually good use 2 row sequencer demonstrate side close filter side open turn first knob 2 row sequencer basically work every step step sequencer close everything hear filter close turn hand go switch everything now highlight couple sound come part come

little button top one middle three step middle stop put way break everything else

good question okay maybe tell little early go restart sequence see push little button rocker switch top row sequencer sound will go point put middle doesnstop doesnplay sound another position mention reset position put different play six step basically tell sequence end always stay within loop understand
okay go back filter part actually use line 2 row sequencer control filter letput 2 voice sound nice basically hear now leave side first two vcos synthesizer also go put right side vcodemonstrates stop sequence
control controller 2 row sequencer use part basically mixer various control voltage trigger use kind will give possibility actually take controller put mixer use take use different filter use actually filter also use filter simultaneously demonstrate high pass low pass actually use pattern control two side band filter turn voltage control filter demonstrate
interest start mix source modulation line will always modulate style go now take freerunning lfo link sequencer freerunning mix synchronize filter movement unsynchronized movement sense always repeat pattern random filter effect time will always stay within beat see hear modulation still hear modulation come sequencer stop sequence question modulation

filter envelope single note

put general envelope filter way filter come say quite simple rough piece plugins nowadays filter envelope every single note little bite question time machine actually build part point 3 row sequencer put modulation every single step mean note point 4 step step sequencer mixer input modulate put modulation modulate nice way work around flaw machine general basic

envelope say put filter attack note play

show 2 restart sequence highlight filter movement certain note sequence try find way good hear okay envelope sound demonstrate usually able set bite beast maybe break plane idea work moment usually able set filter envelope control adsr switch envelope whole side synth

okay thank cool

now listen note sequence now case also set sequencer variable speed mean push th clock will go eight point 3 row sequencer adjust length trigger will wait end weird sequence

triplet five sevens

spend enough time select reset cellphone interrupt subtle change groove make sequence work little fiddle note length basically time make fit kind groove little bite fiddle around wait till end way right point middle 3 row sequencer wait next basically rid sequencer feel actually program basslines use filter movement audio material
interest everything point leave side synthesizer say vc voltagecontrolled example voltagecontrolled oscillator mean lowfrequency oscillator mean use modulation filter also voltage control lfo speed give interest possibility use lfo mess time sequencer now run midi note also go ahead let transfer trigger send synthesizer mess around time use modulation time modulate oscillator filter time need little set
gate point sequence module use gate base trigger control sequencer gate synthesizer take put basically happen connect cable within sequencer module restart sequence use use voltagecontrolled lfo square wave play alter sequence actually still play note right time play trigger right time
now find interest mixture right time wrong time will always stay time time will correspond random time put random time random trigger demonstrate back random now actually use 2 row sequencer filter movement control filter frequency will also use row control speed lfo manipulate time basically close circle manipulate time various note
let cable quick output 2 row sequencer take put control voltage lfo see open control trigger change order note turn knob get slow get fast see somehow
hard see back now mess around time actually general every note letsee sound restart sequence normal time now put time change speed lfo accord note
nice easy way away static sequencer aesthetic normally good work machine example open computer upstairs moog modular v install software version moog modular system also come analog sequencer basically point sequence module modulate time modulate filter oscillator also virtual model feature specific machine do check think install computer also try mainly advantage actually cable select modulation part actually see sound abstract numb type happen learn synthesis general synthesizer build part actually modular synthesizer bad way start
visual actually see course everyone go buy doepfer recently available synthesizer simulation moog arp modular synthesizer plug computer nice platform learn maybe see go day maybe buy modular synthesizer begin look little complicate think nice way learn synthesis general

tell little bite bottom cv mixer

basically simple mixer sum mixer audio mixer point 2 row cv mixer put signal put audio signal distribute point top row cv mixer case control middle row sequencer control control two filter control frequency modulation oscillator find way splice cable couple copy also mix together example use filter take two modulation signal come sequencer come freerunning lfo mix together
filter need mixer splice cable put two different control jack way distribute signal within machine right side cv mixer little bite different story basically four different audio input mean audio distribute leave side synthesizer distribute right side synthesizer go four different audio signal go okay go leave go right go go will go synthesizer will come envelope follower process external audio signal actually synthesizer nice play machine live travel around never sure whether break treat bad plane course
play example band take microphone put drum put ability filter drum put bass play band always hard time tune improvise sequencer general laptop always hard integrate session tap away work doesn find way actually convert incoming audio signal trigger signal way use drummer play trigger signal play beat sequencer will run automatically beat drummer never worry time
play crazy sequencer will go wild nice basically play within session musician without worry keep tempo nothing bad session everyone play click machine run click little chaotic also nice simple way play alongside musician unexpected situation

spin-dry send wet send switch

yes also decide side will follow sequencer follow drummer work bass anything whatever generate trigger side use filter filter trumpet vocal

four send

yes four signal

without add synthetic tone signal

yes basically turn oscillator hear signal come filter external trigger sequencer play strange select way drummer play make now apply letsay filter trumpet filter basically beat filter modulate hand within band make nice actually interaction always try set way modulation sequence

explain make long short note individually instead use envelope tie note

cvgate way midi machine question program use 3 row sequencer make individual long short note problem cvgate give trigger play control cvgate two cable individual length note modulate vca amplifier end whole make simulation long short note within configuration cvgate way

make staccato legato note

configuration midi midi control make note long note short cvgate need 3 row sequencer control length individual note

play keyboard

course play keyboard decide whether stay long short whole set envelope individually need 3 control need cv gate control length every individual note mean work way around part actual configuration

tell trigger sequencer drum example drummer hit snare trigger start play right

set different mode say hit drum start play doesnmake much sense start play will play speed whenever hit whenever trigger come will play speed next come will start match

shorten sequence enough play two note

yes effect slapback sequencer follow beat whenever signal trigger come play note trigger come step along time line show quick 2

latency trigger come

necessarily come external sound lettake drum machine now output drum machine basic beat hear restart sequence see now distribute audio signal drum machine via cv mixer leave side actually hear right now see mix now see trigger generate point envelope follower signal come time example take get information drum machine drum machine still run okay trigger work usual case smirk basically point leave side synthesizer basically sequencer work filter bank side basically tenband filter nothing mysterious spectacular question machine

dial middle leave side synthesizer tell us call give us demonstration

okay let restart sequence oscillator side waveform output mean loud module tune demonstrate go way way finetuning actually tune track instrument whatever demonstrate finetune every oscillator important go tune easy whenever good fit music grab record take somehow twiddle around recall nothing go go magic moment tune oscillator actually start work important late play bass play guitar tune
actually normal guitar tuner tune every oscillator c whatever go restart sequence vco fm mean frequency modulation modulation input grab example freerunning lfo turn will modulate frequency oscillator note play also frequency modulation depend waveform square wave switch demonstrate
course also use modulation available right side lfo bandwidth square wave basically regulate wideness square wave every analog machine bandwidth modulation basically enable modulate manually
okay basically work vco way filter work way go filter frequency envelope voltagecontrolled filter decide much filter actually go filter envelope look filter envelope take beat plane qfactor selfresonance filter warm filter without resonance modulation
way modulate frequency oscillator basically modulate frequency filter vcf external sound input mean come source externally put directly filter without device take example white noise add white noise filter
less think obviously take beat stop sequence go external sound source directly filter let run work module top row leave side envelope output say vca voltage control amplifier basically tell loud overall sound side amplify also control voltage control envelope follower generate trigger
lfo ring modulation phaseshifter weak machine normally phaser modulation sample hold noise generator explain specifically hard keep general machine studio available everybody play along
afraid cable nothing wrong break take put bad happen nothing happen try freak around ask question quite big field quite unlimited possibility inaudible question will set small dj mixer headphone output whenever people work studio synthesizer need sit headphone come powerbook record generate noise frequency record onto computer use
think try make understand public way sometimes quite hard follow hand try will see much selfexplaining

phaseshifter work

expect question basically another modulation go signal double signal put phase make nice flange effect try weak system good one moog phaseshifter example sound nice particularly good honest put otherwise hole

use voice microphone signal external modulation

yes basically line input point cv mixer work line signal use voice instrument guitar control sound also envelope follower give trigger give trigger envelope basically trigger signal envelope control patch certain way control filter actually external audio also mean voice

okay thank

tell way signal take module

basically modular synthesizer basic structure inside mean even cable front way oscillator go filter oscillator control envelope course audio signal go filter go amplifier end
basically signal filter put basic structure see cable front module start sequence sequence run actually work without cable put letsay whenever put will modulate certain part put basically cv gate cable attach will play exhaust

thank
