literally way work last year numb dj rinse fm occasionally work properly pirate station stream online people record people record show immediately go live local area web site call barefilescom huge archive grime dubstep radio show connection local pirate radio station web archive mix quite amaze fuelinjection music spread

internationally mean people via web site particular
kode
definitely

right talk dmz every scene historically epicenter paradise garage blue coop happen break beat another call fwd play vital role rise dubstep
kode
original dark garage night way every two week thursday start sunday night velvet room charing cross road move plastic people shoreditch east london tiny little club amaze sound system
think dubstep spoil sound system plastic people fwd now every friday night dmz sound system mass brixton sound system have bass music word clear sound system physical experience everything vibrate slide across surface whole place vibrate dubstep doesn work unless everything shake

vibe mystikz night tell pretty much light dark
kode
light dark room everything vibrate strip minimal simple sound

whereas grime certain degree much mc mention dubstep much find mc night fwd
kode
mean fwd always mixture grime dubstep sometimes lucky hear grime mc dubstep vice versa mc dubstep keep company music alongside music time bite strange dubstep work vocalist call spaceape

long
kode
since

right
kode
first release weird

let listen
kode
cover prince sign time let take get grab record

nice play word
kode
tune call sine dub hasngotten beat think actually laptop bass effect vocal vocal dub poetry style
music kode spaceape sine dub

abouts meet spaceape
kode
old friend mine first track together quick half hour have never do vocal vocal quickly somewhere start favorite track go record record lyric lyric read lyric put quick bass effect boom put voice bite

initial reaction tune people bite
kode
doesn fit anywhere

obviously tempo fine play set
kode
wasndeliberately people hear connection berlin dub people rhythm sound also time grime call devil mix people wiley make track bass beat mc spit people make connection berlin dub people think connection devil mix grime random

obviously someone else come little bite late end label whose seem obvious connection burial tell us little burial
kode
burial guy get contact start web magazine side uk garage have send tune five six year four five year put last year press sell quite quickly cool keep send clearly man put album put album right around may music quite stagger feedback sell doesn fit anywhere definitely tangent dubstep sound vague reminiscent berlin uk guy think quite dark melancholy

touch whole lack much mc host dubstep night think big problem drum bass especially mc night music become rewind many rewind sudden producer make tune sudden revolve around heavy impact drop actually construct tune agree possibly happen grime correlation mc style
kode
generally mc play mc people dubstep instrumental music everybody theory anything go wrong jungle drum bass different theory around anything anymore issue wasnmcs certain side take side loud noisy aggressive rhythmically stupid simple bore consider jungle come rhythmically excite music have hear life end weird

fo long many producer talk fact maybe touch yesterday lecture music bpms much space breathe music slow little bite space breathe inject much life think dubstep certain degree offer bite solution
kode
think definitely counterbalance drum bass go fast fast towards gabber around bpm also now halfstep actually go even slow definitely draw people away drum bass definitely counterbalance way drum bass evolve
remember interview lemon have dillinja moan fast everything get say gonna think peer pressure dancefloor drug raver crave demand overwhelm pressure guy earn live havenheard many people try slow

anything get even fast another interest always sub genre sudden get split micro genre say halfstep start see even dubstep new little side genre pop exactly halfstep example
kode
dubstep lot different rhythmic style think halfstep simple style lot space mix perfect sound little bite instrumental grime production value different sub bass much strong feel quite slow play track spaceape halfstep halfstep bass drive music along oppose drum drum quite space track call backward early year
music kode spaceape backward
actually weird feel slow actually people go big style dance

actually dance half
kode
almost imagine fast music add double time

people jungle certain degree
kode
opposite jungle jungle slow dub reggae bass line double time break almost dubstep double time break subtract actually quite sparse almost sluggish people people dance double time people lock anyway lazy skanking people properly lock dance double time weird watch quite slow music

right mean many producer half step moment
kode
probably good halfstep producer way prototypical halfstep sound guy call loefah huge brick wall bass sparse minimal rhythm

ask seem grime kick young producer allow growth music much come fact young kid easy access basic software fruityloops mean example production set look still people produce fruity
kode
think kid still mean week think still fruity get fruity amaze use use fruity year ago produce age use pretty much use anything standardly reason logic think matter software use mean particular good example doesn matter get fruityloops cool

obviously bass heavy music mean good set monitor essential part kit
kode
standard mean hard music reference sound studio sound huge sound system music easy overdo bass studio dubplates cut place south london describe place call transition describe bass management often mold bass hold back little bite bring control little bite work work big system effectively cut dub reggae age jungle now dubstep

interest happen now technology available pretty much every genre music everyone go direction serato drum bass dj pretty much last bastion certain degree dubplate culture yet seem whole culture alive dubstep
kode
mean strong dubstep certainly anti prefer sound vinyl sound dubplates mind bite crackle music dubplates last play quite quickly start get crackle think useful way build sound handful producer cut dubplates word get master early try master early stage come immediately create level play field hear compare producer go master process
quite useful people try build sound build nothing invent new variant hardcore continuum talk

mean drum bass music house spot dubstep
kode
transition forest hill south london

mean cost side mean obviously cut plate economically stack
kode
mean everyone love pound cut dubplate two track fifty pound real maniacal dubplate cutter spend much money nobody particularly make money everybody seem quite happy put money sound way work

say example someone book play fwd turn cd wallet probably
kode
people play cd especially sound system plastic people beautiful sound system sound clean room cool cd hurt ear toppy sound sharp come cd think think maybe downside people fruity straight cd without master

mean also get element vip culture special offs maybe close friend dj
kode
certain extent mean cut dubplate make tune cut dubplate day people kind little different version different occasion money scene everybody special people general quite happy cut tune

back production mean process work mean start beat work around sample
kode
wouldnsay particular formula usually hear piece music will stay notice three week late hum tune often way work melodica big augustus pablo fan play instrument melodica cool work tune relatively quickly near computer work tune play take computer play midi keyboard whatever way make tune

average long spend tune
kode
tune play day first tune release without beat sine dub couple hour tune take week set rule

mean recent time work finish album tell us bite album
kode
album call memory future couple week include four five early hyperdub release lot new spaceape dark mean find dark people tell dark find quite uplift think bite twist

mean video
kode
t

video
kode


okay
kode
video track album couple art student make us myspace anyone want watch sum video sum quite get

shall listen album
kode
first track album call glass
music kode spaceape glass

term vocalist spaceape work past plan work vocalist
kode
release track female jamaican vocalist call warrior queen track album

track bug
kode
track release bug warrior queen

tell us bite label hyperdub long now
kode
three year

three year first set essentially mean see label production
kode
specifically production know slightly weird necessarily fit label plan avenue release naturally happen hear people bite weird think take interest direction release bug warrior queen release burial still mainly term production avenue put without persuade someone

else quite interest talk yesterday talk anyone run label day news isn good funnily enough sale rather recent time
kode
big label right direction even vinyl sale cool day age vinyl sale cd sale great reason think vinyl experience little bite resurgence people suffer way another tiny label start build think aspiration realistic perhaps label around long time experience vinyl different period lifespan therefore practically suicidal now happen vinyl sale

think parallel maybe fact talk support vinyl dubplate culture within dubstep young people gig actually see guy play plate rather serato cd keep whole vibe alive think true certain degree maybe
kode
maybe think way scene grow clone go word people come hear music first time see core scene copy copy sound copy mannerism copy fact use dubplates scene grow way music work way everything work way another way grow small big must involve element copy think impact craze dubplate fetishist

start see scene emerge outside london outside uk production see much production come far corner globe
kode
good little scene berlin new york play brazil next month suppose russia china japan term production still good come south london hear amaze track holland recently good come germany us people brazil make sometimes have little copy people bring local flavor local music scene music maybe take bite time

head russia pretty soon
kode
local music scene russia

else note course wellrespected producer also wellrespected writer write book little now halfway tell us sound interest
kode
book use abuse sound system bookcalled sonic warfare range everything mc clash soundclashes use sound system competitive conflictual situation use vocal cord respect right us military research acoustic weaponry iraq now full spectrum people use abuse sound system people use sound control manipulate write fair bite sonic brand call earworms earworms basically catchy tune stick head try head stick think think musician earworms
weird military research sciencefiction basically quite believe attempt try sound commercially available device uk call mosquito anyoneheard
basically buy device shopkeeper buy example fit outside shop basically target yearolds base principle joke sound joke sound science fiction base principle old lose high frequency hear device emit mean use device apparently rid rat mouse use device group youth sensitive frequency range hz upper end audible frequency spectrum suppose annoy go away disperse case use sound either highvolume sound highfrequency sound lowfrequency sound make people feel uneasy usually disperse crowd
doesnsound realistic little test try basically website device mosquito test tone hz right gauge hear see hear bite fuck highfrequency hear high frequency play tone see people hear science behind say old lose high frequency therefore device affect middleaged people affect kid pressrelease image website commercial device kid hooded top smoke cigarette play frequency see people hear expect many people hear unless closet dog
hz play hz anyone hear play hz old play hz hear couldnhear play hz hear go principle device suppose work say sciencefictional make think lose contact line sciencefiction reality device market

long research book
kode
oh quite long time squeeze busy schedule last year hopefully finish next month

producer whole process try record release try book publish another look forward part
kode
set record label cut middleman bite music industry set publish company long

another couple term hear coin use whole ecology fear explain also bass materialism sound pretty interest explain little bite
kode
simply bass materialism book quite theoretical bass materialism okay year western philosophy whenever engage music way another classical music art music bass materialism drop bass bomb top western philosophy see happen

ecology fear
kode
ecology fear basically background book particularly post fear dominant mechanism politic work globally look aspect via way use sound last whatever year produce fear obviously horror film classic example shrill sound also come dub reggae culture relationship dread bass culture

right anyone question moment

sorry forget back story sonic warfare bite animal massive rat problem original studio record tago mago vitamin c early holger czukay go rid mouse rat turn oscillator high frequency two day late animal go whole problem four five day late group go massive outrage big argument group almost split someone come conclusion machine still switch become happy work place
kode
conspiracy theory search net acoustic weaponry hear story science lab suddenly everybody start feel ill nauseous lab nobody work realize ventilator fan emit infrasound infrasonic frequency low frequency basically connect different part body different resonant frequency eyeball will vibrate certain frequency will seem hallucination basically eyeball vibrate vision hz
load story people unexplainable nausea feeling look online conspiracy theory surround quite difficult separate reality bullshit obviously anyone interest bassy music hear brown note certain low frequency allegedly suppose make run toilet

question

example france paris quite know dubstep close london explain fact example scene uk garage grime doesntouch country town paris
kode
mean play paris time people think tell think french quite protectionist come culturally country compare place germany usually quite open music come london

example drum bass uk hiphop ninja tune big dada
