yes chorus tend go play around word sometimes even use real word play around sound use vocal percussion instrument try make strong possible

advice producer use straight local music street sound basically



suppose try use particular street sound particular place world locationspecific particular place learn shouldn need aware deal music general level

basically think happen generally think everyone producer vocalist songwriter think important get somewhere specific place doesneven matter place grow someplace interest think important try fade far track completely need present track use else incorporate song

need pretend angolan make

exactly idea behind whole

side respect artist make music guess try talk easy take street culture say way operate make sure give write credit people side issue around respect credit money

definitely people tend grab try show world credit obviously ever hear kuduro artist right work give everyone write credit probably anyway register write society anyway tend invite people work us instead buy people pay bring home

criticism level sound global useless way describe magpie people come take glitter brilliance street music around world package feel

us natural grow listen different music see bad take profit anything build zero try make professional way try treat everyone professional guy ever someone like music make music love soon credit people make original music even call kuduro call batida mean beat make beat sound kuduro actually clean
