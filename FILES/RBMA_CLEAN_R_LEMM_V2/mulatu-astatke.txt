listen popular music time say latin music similarity notice music country

great connection latin african music listen rhythm nigeria ghana senegal also eastern part africa rhythm cuban play also play africa give example go cuba first question show first african land give chance go sit start play dance language spanish rhythm movement everything have see west africa
drummer come west africa cuban count onetwothreefour play straight rhythm music hear dancer discussion dancer drummer connection latin african music probably difference call montunos repetitive sound latin music differ african maybe go eastern africa swahili music similarity swahili music call kikareke equivalent mambo mambo two latin jazz happen mambo music tend go fast excite kikareke tend go slow think african music latin much difference course development latin jazz maybe closeness america numb cuban new york listen jazz develop fast african music

believe first recording make entitle afro latin soul recording incorporate element modern latin sound hear ethiopian melody scale correct

explain think rhythm think latin rhythm african arrangement arrangement close latin montunos mine ethiopian music usually base five tone music five always easy merge two scale careful voicings chord progression hear music fivetone pentatonic scale sometimes doesnmerge together find way merge five nice chord progression voice music become successful doesnlose flavor five tone

arenfamiliar music theory explain mean fivetone scale versus tone scale

music now base five tone scale four different mode write melody call tizita take c have e g five tone call tizita scale actually use jazz musician day minor one c have eflat g flat b make interest scale

basically divide octave

major 2 3 minor 3

move c c five step oppose remifa twelve step

yes five major scale another call bati interest go c e f g b c interest call bati make nice sound bati minor go c eflat f g bflat minor bati anchi hoye anchi hoye base c have e go f g c interest another call anchi hoye jazz musician love scale go c dflat f gflat minor go c dflat f g flat c four different mode use compose music work use different progression voicings scale song hear screen base scale

first record music challenge incorporate traditional mode tone music add mention montuno piano riff have play original record illustrate

montunos maybe
music faram gami faram

do year ago new york talk merge five five tonescale back montunos flavor still make interest ethiopian montuno use five scale use bati scale use nicely nice approach make ethiojazz interest

scale use convey different emotion specific circumstance

word say youth youth isnscared anything usually move forward especially quiet part say
