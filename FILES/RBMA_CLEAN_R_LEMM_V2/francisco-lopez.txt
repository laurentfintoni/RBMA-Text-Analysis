thank come first lecture lovely day great pleasure sit next
experimental artist musician sonicist
many music specific think may good
start composition make call la
selva
may go ahead play play put
image screen place central work
year explain mean afterwards
interest time play excerpt minute
piece play minute
music la selva

thank much thank everyone come lecture
mention fragment composition soundpiece
make recording nonmixed nontransformed straight
recording rainforest costa rica live work
numb year want start rainforest
transformative force extremely influential experience have
work rainforest world long time
image amazon brazil residency workshop every year
rainforest

rainforest
first place

also biologist research teach biology
many year somehow life say dr jekyll mr hyde numb
reason research biology sound music two
parallel entire life experience rainforest
someone work spend extend period time
field expose richness
environment sonic richness many aspect particular
relation sound originally draw rainforest research biology also sound recording among
particularly important rainforest environment
extremely rich incredible complexity sound
hour constant change variety range incredible
see source sonic complexity say s
naturally acousmatic
environment mean place amaze sonic display
time see source sound invisible
world basically pretty much organism
live environment basically predate escape
survive environment listen aspect
rainforest relation sound extremely strong influence
work

loud record cicada
think animal rainforest hear loudly
almost never see right front face never actually
see strange experience think

record hear lot frog course many different
species frog time way naturally happen
particular environment also cicada leafhopper produce high
frequency bird bunch case
cicada especially daytime cicada extremely loud
hear close almost impossible find
paradox intense rich face experience
find visually source sound intense paradox
beauty time natural environment

interest record think
good way talk approach music decide
tell people exactly exactly record
recording try create
situation expectation necessarily
decide la selva important let people

answer question image different location
world do field recording spend
life travel around recording kind place
rainforest natural environment also city manmade
environment artificial environment kind paradox
answer question interest representation
interest soundscapes represent reality recording
simulate reenact recompose listen
reality believe work reality call reality convince futile attempt reproduce reality
interest back forth reality
sound composition artificial way reproduce sound
show example way actually complex interaction
substance reality come reality sound recording
way photograph intricate relationship reference
reality reproduce reality explore
substance reality word phenomenological approach
connection reality interest substance reality
texture complexity richness virtual space idea space
reality idea time reality
necessarily representational particular piece play
fragment begin la selva cd release piece
information booklet cd booklet close begin indication short text advise listener
open booklet way do different way
strategy allow listener decide go path return
information case come
reality way listen
sound will change natural process normal process obviously influence
especially deal call real sound
definitely influence way listen
reality experience reality place
want information place hand listener
decide much access information
relation listen experience

seem fullyformed philosophy
grow madrid listen type
music lead path

always interest music perhaps sound music
kind music start
play drum different band postpunk time new wave
punk interest different kind music
interest couldn realize develop band frustration play band always compromise
let also extreme limitation
play instrument feel sound
feel hear reality time already sound
recording always extreme difference possibility
work sound imaginable way technology time
completely different today obviously
instrument nothing wrong instrument field
range possibility work sound much wide also different
rule reality way sound unfold way happen reality
dramatically different happen instrumental realm general
begin always feel want wasnclear
exactly want relate
complexity richness reality view way beyond
instrument

certain band open eye idea
possibility people worth explore


definitely early industrial music reference start
listen esplendor geom√©trico band madrid actually know even grow
neighborhood madrid band throb gristle course spk maurizio bianchi italy hunt lodge state time small constellation different band industrial music exactly connect work sound recording definitely
experiment direction find appeal towards
abstract obscure perhaps also open way deal sound
feel people work area feel
anything possible little term aesthetic
technology term aesthetic possible
different tradition rock roll pop culture also
tradition music appeal territory
little whatever want proceed
path take place late cassette culture
involve call home music network cassette culture within
international network people work home music cassette music
territory whatever want anything
proper musical technical education sound
school letsay international community change
collaboration mail many different artist world

first produce sound weren t
already field record cassette


yes also begin feel
recording quite different original normally s
understand isn real people will say record
record real sure need look
different way sometimes record
good reality intuitive way feel
begin always feel recording different
world deficient world world self
contain rule parameter richness many respect actually
good reason think world recording may
good reality machine use capture reality reality
big advantage think
perceive reality
incredible around order close anything
perceive reality without think perception reality always
cognitive prejudice besides
think creature see reality model see reality
hear reality now machine within range within range
microphone encode whatever think
massive advantage point always first intuitive
way now perhaps elaborate experience always
cooperate machine stop criticize
efficient cooperate feel begin
feel way wasninterested
representation first recording start work
development personal way world make substance
reality independent selfsustained selfcontained world
substance reality fact example time
wasnthinking composition first
transform crude rudimentary way work cassette recorder
extremely limit technology studio mixer
course computer also good equipment fiddle around
cassette recorder play example transformation
reality

sure call

untitled piece untitled
music untitled
thank

seem strange interest philosophy seem almost fully form
early idea possibility endless
scope need broaden somehow wonder come easily seem

time ability articulate idea
perhaps today gut feel first
taste sound numb people taste mean
direction create find appeal
feel reason interest recording relate
question reproduce environment place voice
people whatever intuitive clear idea
interest sound texture sound world start
unfold time wouldnsay way wouldn clear
try work different world work
sound direction find interest

say call untitled work untitled
think sort make break title almost
anything wonder

piece untitled numb
reason give name piece release trigger whole
discussion trigger also social issue mean example
struggle record label record label
description extreme case release
come record label release end
people record label tell untitled do
call cd untitled give
title funny situation wasn
want make statement day next
different question give title piece fundamental
question believe contribute somehow give clue
listener purpose mean particular release piece
believe mean possibility record actually open
listener decide experience
sound piece reason struggle
numb different situation record label sometimes live presentation concert
installation always question yes
mean express people
believe express music try
constant struggle ideal situation
everything untitled late release hold cd entitle manage little case do different strategy also confrontation reality
create place give name place
listener decide connection
hear listen connection place case la selva
name place costa rica

also release numb release building
new york also title correct

project sound environment large office building apartment building new
york sound environment building heat system
electrical system elevator name release
come call building new york
clear make certain building new york use material
transform now connection
hear listen question
mention representational

lettalk live show infamous guess good
word describe often people blindfold sit
try minimize much possible term see
people see similar record way
people draw conclusion guess part
process try allow people experience put
onto tell s
make

let bring gentleman explain minute
give summary version
video israeli news broadcast concert
give news version television think s
right different work year
reconfiguration situation listen mean first
reconfiguration performative space refuse use stage
configuration stage mean stage also
move away frontal soundsystems use surround system multi
channel soundsystems usually system adapt
different space example performance arrangement
space different country slideshow start
within limitation space possibility different space
see clear configuration seat audience
equipment normally middle space
middle letsay audience mean hear little
audience hear stage follow sound
monitor prototypical situation different music
stage live work sound
produce sound instrument transform sound manipulate
sound physical phenomenological entity space need
audience doesnmean every single person audience
hear obviously difference space
different story reconfiguration space first
aspect audience order hear little
2 audience look towards center
look outward face speaker around configuration
do many different way different space try
generate basically immersive experience sound
reconfiguration happen also dark blindfold
audience reconfiguration space play different space different system
combination performance sound
installation many different way
switch photo slideshow example soundsystems different space installation speaker spanish pavilion expo take place spain year ago
amaze system move sound around good
good presence sound relative space another story
perhaps recent installation new york system
speaker two concentric dome concert hall rainforest
recording many different place world turn hyperreal
rainforest fact name performance installation hyper
rainforest
represent rainforest use element many different
rainforest create extremely hyperrealistic beyondnormal
representation experience complexity material
much modest installation forest france filter frequency
insect different forest turn subtle small
onepersontime installation forest installation
matadero two year ago extremely comfortable recliner
use try obliterate presence body somehow
extent happen use combination speaker headphone
simultaneously speaker around recliner plus additional
listen headphone interest combination
combine two interest also do
literal immersion underwater concert underwater speaker underwater
totally different realm many different reason rule
acoustic underwater different rule behavior
possibility listen also different

fascinate spend quite time
underwater research acoustic different assume

want spend time opportunity concert
london pool organize collective people london organize
performance underwater different pool across uk incredible
opportunity unusual performance unfortunately
much time soundcheck hour
soundcheck quite complicate jump water
back mix board back water back mix board


mean spin-dry completely touch mix
board

wasn obviously even performance jump
water listen certain part come back water
new territory work
quickly case whatever
time interest experience
realization interest work time
dedication true different nature happen underwater
underwater difficult localize source sound may
advantage course difficult drive low frequency
density medium need extremely powerful speaker
produce low frequency underwater doesnhappen
underwater speaker stereo stereo underwater
completely different set rule think need explore time
performance select many material think
work feature acoustic environment think little
succeed extent experience factor obviously
people dive long
breathe swim move around water cold
performance performer take place couple hour couple hour cold water quite
challenge listen learn experience
will another chance work underwater
blindfold start use

start point either power say
gonna say

think mid start realize
impossible space completely dark space pitch black
difficult much difficult seem sometimes
turn light everything seem dark minute start see use darkness also typically
middle audience equipment light turn
opposite start suggest idea provide blindfold
optional voluntary use audience people haven
force blindfold voluntarily talk photo blindfold audience slideshow always emphasize
begin performance crucial aspect highlight fact
force anyone optional
individual darkness blindfold listen good
see anything visual component perception
dominate obliterate sometimes hear else
happen predict plan happen
way collectively voluntarily else sense
collective commitment voluntary acceptance unusual way
follow performance create somehow collective ritual game
voluntarily accept create
collective sense commitment listen short time
performance perhaps even important aspect see
therefore listen good

seem listener read
interview commitment anything else music make
pretty important nice product blindfold
extra commitment

yes say commitment
expect everyone mean whoever want try
offer commitment dedication work do order create
experience ask demand think
commitment somehow dissipate think
overload information problem much information
many focus attention
consequence question find
information also reduction decrease commitment
individual sure extent problem
whether adapt different strategy s
definitely question commitment try
offer strong intense experience sound
commitment think reach individually different territory
personal emotional internal control mean
think extremely interest territory think
course aspect synaesthetic experience see hear
course start imagine start see
somehow personal reaction happen naturally think synaesthesia multimedia inside body interest multimedia intermedium transmedia aspect inside body outside body think voluntarily temporarily refuse
sense deprivation discover multimedia
inside body mind combination two

experience work music hard
work

definitely experience work music
solitary studio work also live performance studio
system system use live
performance live performance become interest
intense experience sound way happen
system space largescale situation
way live performance combination
enjoy experience different every space
every soundsystem responsibility create interest
experience people beyond certain limit mean good
control intensity contrast dynamic live performance
belief people work sound today t
much sound generate sound
see sloppiness work sound think whoever work
sound live situation responsibility
crazy example damage hear people easy
small movement fader knob dramatic effect live space
live performance combination excitement enjoyment
responsibility

mention word dissipation minute ago seem
word big essay work
finish call dissipation music believe tell us little bite mean become central idea work

time th century romanticism numb
poet musician poet create idea write
extensively description absolute music defend
idea high form art music music ineffable music
trigger emotion
different effect without mean anything specific without anything
particular without us able translate word
question reach point feel poetry limit
language way couldngo beyond language convention
make crude description basically idea
form form art ineffable
translate word good efficient way music
music incredible potential western world
reaction happen immediately th century
point music predominantly western culture use opus storytelling
opus reaction brief moment
history western music idea th century
reconfigure idea structure music
music come music come break
convention structure break convention source sound
music music process brief moment
history western music exception actually brief moment
music wasn anything music convention
technology mean expression anything far
intense conception music absolute absolute sense
music th century maybe be
sure maybe connect idea th century st century question dissipation music much
experience music strong fundamental sense may
dissipate numb structuralist conception
music structuralist conception music apply traditional music apply course pop rock culture traditional
systematic aesthetic structure style
respect kind music actually many different kind music
interest explore territory attempt
move away structure technology technology sense talk
show putting forward make music move
territory think clear example be
follow certain strategy direction strategy percent efficient course problem stradegies work
strategy bring listener
territory hope blank phenomenological territory experience

regard people work today peer people work towards
philosophy obviously do enormous
amount collaboration imagine everyone
philosophy music certain people connect

people connect term music make sound
make do collaboration people different
connection term idea presentation idea
convey music public situation record release
different among people john duncan
american artist also work dark perhaps different
reason different way bbut also much idea
create work fear example stress put people
dangerous situation exactly play share part
territory reason work dark common
us collaborate perhaps case clear
share part

mention do enormous amount collaboration
look website day take probably minute
read name people do look
collaborator anything else

suppose learn influence somebody external somebody
different idea bring different element make
say feel need collaborator every time
collaborate learn new always feel influence
less partly positive bring never imagine
typical musicmaking collaboration general
music definitely come equation collaboration
aspect different play instrument collaboration
every single person produce sound manipulate
sound imaginable way contribution somebody else
equivalent contribution add layer element texture
instrument isn say good
instrument degree transformation degree
contribution somebody work quite wide
anything example practise
record pass somebody else somebody else
transformation come back real
time real time back forth possibility transformation
large big interest collaboration probably
idea contribution term specific sound component
collective group musicmaking

maybe play two three collaboration do show
breadth happen work someone
music reinier van houdt untitled
thank thank make sound piano
another example short piece short track two minute make
friend czech republic recording give
recording track sense collaboration
base exclusively recording simple will
recognize immediately
music unknown
thank believe sound snore last
example perhaps couple minute collaboration
time take recording make year ago make
piece recording mutate transform radically
process evolve somehow look long
time ago try eye today
come originally idea different sense
degree transformation sound come originally sound
recording real extreme
many generation transformation sound transform
sound 3 generation generation will begin
2 common
extensively happen many generation many
turn people say abstract
abstract actually concrete anyway real result
process
music unknown
thank

think ask letstart
first piano player soften old age
conventional instrument make plain

old let
piano composition young let matter
experience work musician composition ensemble
example berlin suppose take seriously
less case give opportunity
interest work realm may give try
happen many year entire sound world
fingertip basically explore ensemble
musician piano player give opportunity

certain point realize get take seriously
enter another echelon people talk around
wasn anymore experimental composer


yes happen case happen many year s
example performance first
opportunity performance madrid time place remember people electronic scene time tell wasnmusic wasnworth refuse example track compilation album experimental music release madrid
tell music within realm experimental
music way place music
live also think couldn music live have
always studio person

breakthrough

probably start first show actually
state discover collaboration different artist
state actually give opportunity actually work
live perform live experience
discover live performance
work live performance even play sample
prerecord believe
live work generate sound s
transform specialize sound simultaneous process
different controller work come
experience realization important live
work sound require work
necessarily generator sound instrumental electronic

technology enable good year
always able live transform sound

change technology allow definitely flexibility
wide range quality final result also portability
important travel live different
place numb year computer currently studio
everything else studio quality computer
denaturalization quality computer gearoriented
person use gear gear happy
live time process
need laptop tool use basically pro tool
simple edit sound peak much technology come computer fact
anywhere simple way cheap way
happy live time change technology
allow enormous flexibility achieve
simple mean example difference
professional technology studio field record letsay
amateur technology difference gigantic today difference
narrow point almost point
billion people professional think
difference price equipment doesnreflect difference
quality talk quality music talk
technical quality sound think basically point
difference tell will challenge anyone tell
record master
master release now currently computer point
much experience think experience give way
interest way much technology
definitely change technology towards people call
democratization technology though prefer socialization technology
big change big relief

2 composition play obviously snore think hear another
snore maybe composition

make confession combine snore exgirlfriends
happen record year
suppose symbolic

think need go suppose new question humor music



laugh end snore hilarious

think extent humor everything
limit personal subjective sense whatever think
always humor different way sometimes little obvious way
example think

last strike remind much especially
early silence play enormous role tell little bite
perspective use force sound suppose

use silence part composition different track
extensive way sometimes absolute silence mean digitally speak
sound record sometimes quasisilence pseudosilence
subtle difference dynamic average level
record maximum peak minimum dramatic limit
audible record live performance
great length contrast effect contrast effect
dynamic balance important also
process happen take place mostly
call loudness war production studio apply compressor
different technique make commercial music sound loud strong
radio broadcast process take place
production realm also take place live performance festival everywhere
course risk lose dynamic lose contrast
lose strength contrast contrast come
strength strength impression create richness
music performance create rely dramatically contrast
silence extreme ultimate contrast sound
use many different way think obvious fundamental
part music use kind music use silence
extreme way example stream minute silence middle
piece create feeling void wonder check level
check equipment sometimes intention intention
fundamental component music typical reaction
see idea conceptual use
silence every time use silence seem somehow
tradition history use silence conceptual case try make statement void music john cageian
statement opposite fundamental block make
sound probably clear way show agent contrast
dynamic

write bunch aphorism music process put website oneline
interest strike quite bite
work hard create useless proud have
create useless career

hope

hope

mean useless sense clear application clear
intention clear mean expression reason put
world useless sense contrast work
put forward present advance realm music example
technically aesthetically perhaps useless philosophical sense
sense create unknown purpose unknown use
control context control
expression expression

happen put thought

work cuba work cuba become philosophical
guarantee anyone travel tourist probably
work cuba live cuban definitely bind become
philosophical

travel quite bite mention seem much home base conscious choice philosophical choice

philosophical personal choice yes definitely mention be
gearoriented person objectoriented person
problem physical object psychological problem material
taht possess
fact somebody else
possess responsible responsible
physical probably lack responsibility
probably also draw sound sound immaterial
physical manifestation time powerful
powerful force physical may immaterial s
always somewhere physical support need carry
especially today material level reach allow us
bring sound music small physical even need
carry cloud whatever somewhere
amount space physical presence require much little painting sculpture
example bless definitely bless
allergy material

obviously cd enormous carrier information put
vinyl do cassette optimum format
depend release mind

depend release cassette release long time
ago cassette come back course happen imagine
will resurrection cassette think
resurrection format combination new format old format
reason nothing music nostalgia
sometimes fascination object technology
today will adapt format vinyl
release example basically make scratch sound vinyl
format allow different think
great react medium cd today basically remnant
industry industry anymore never industry
experimental music sure people interest
experimental music mostly electronic music interest
physical support vinyl course coolness appeal vinyl
different story perhaps year now cd will also
appeal already appeal old
situation

seem nostalgic type person

always think now next normally

many project work right now every time seem read
interview

make work parallel many project way
work maybe different project make
collaboration field recording different country
work cartoon right now cartoon sound work parallel
different project variety
time think result

cartoon project

project filmmaker montr√©al permission use
soundtrack include everything dialogue sound effect everything
old cartoon national
film archive canada

read correct wrong first interest music come
watch puppet show strange sound
internet lie

episode kid interest
puppet magical combination
present somehow mystery puppet show bunch puppet show
see kid kid entertain
mysterious scary perhaps world happen
alive independent selfcontained s
idea another world always feel keen wellconnected
world analog simulation different reality
storytelling drive towards much music
connection creation selfcontained world

untitled probably project
haven do look forward need do
point

always happen every time start record new project
always surprise way work never conceive
plan always depend sound happen start combine transform mix sound always
surprise especially plan beforehand case
every single time surprise imagine will happen
process difficult predict expect
happen process surprise discovery
keep way far today keep
now discover new look wasnlooking
process discovery still happen today hope
continue forever

find though descend formula three four release
think oh do process
sound project different work always
different end product even formula end
radically different

interest compare parameter judge change music
artist band compare work realm creation art
paint paint painter never expect produce
completely different paint every time paint expect
paint style evolve year yes perhaps expect produce completely different every week
music myth paradigm constant dramatic brutal restless
novelty every month every week every release every album every person
think create many think create new
style music every week think individual group
people band create completely different every single release myth doesnhappen compare album
people may try different doesn t
happen question expect exactly unclear
think work admire different people may painter artist
appreciate consistency solid body work somehow
vision question much novelty
consistency world construct block block step
step piece piece way see mostly course
repeat repeat strategy taste
clearly style style come influence
term release example imbalance pace creation
somebody pace commercial possibility market course
business term many release put
different label year always myth somebody s
putting release quickly quality
good little quality see
talk right now artist see artist produce
little interest see artist produce
every single interest whether
change another matter always interest artist
record every day artist compulsive interest
concern production term release record every
single day thousand thousand hour recording
creation think every person different pace wouldnrecommend anyone
follow specific pace album year
important important difficult discover
pace pace independent commercial social
consideration follow pace now release
create different story think create
pace difficult discover good pace creation

end open question audience
potentially stupid question make good field record

eye beholder make good field record
artist work lofi way approach field recording
think make clear interest representation job
call perfect field record perfect
field record idea people mean
different sound technician work nature documentary
example will idea perfect sound record artist
will completely different idea objective
record real doesnexist also
relate question intention desire feeling

make good field record

every time field record

intention always different

intention record record
exploration first mine substance reality
will happen future
record unclear may preference certain sound
course every person different preference may draw certain
sound good record unclear
work work recording simple technology
fact use today record sound zoom recorder
cheap recorder think now ‚Ç¨ record four
track extremely simple cheap use field
recording mean professional recorder will challenge
professional recorder tell production piece
do compare quality even technical point view
sound

thank open question anyone

hello understand philosophy towards recording
marry sound film almost blasphemous ever
consider work filmmaker maybe collaborative

2 part question key make collaborative
work filmmakers work filmmakers
dancer normal work occasionally do
impression always problem
work sound image especially film doesnmatter
say doesnmatter always soundtrack film call
collaboration also film military hierarchy clear
director film boss supreme person make
film collaboration hand hand close intimate collaboration
real collaboration talk putting sound image talk
take decision image structure image
accord sound back forth
context film gonna hard time name
level film director
real collaboration problem
happen much film much relate medium
tradition presentation medium film
problem time much worry
name size letter director s
acknowledgement make process
image influence sound vice versa

will maybe uncredited
party maybe pseudonym

possible solution problem work person may good understand person film
person industrycultural environment way present
time film screen film director
difficult convince
present show work do even put
clearly difficult make understand way
context presentation film make difficult

hello first respect deep knowledge sound
entire universe sound different
sound around us standard good sound
bad sound interest

good bad sound song

sound interest give pleasure


look question different way sometimes
hear sound feel moment sometimes
experience hear sound potential
sometimes listen record re
imagine potential sound
say okay start
imagine answer will different depend re
deal general interest sound have
record kind experience studio
probably knowledge different transformation
sound will allow go many different territory
potential substance many different type
think important answer question
try much look hear much
cultural natural context hear sound
difficult bring completely different realm
example fascination common fascinate
sound source sound people fascinate
instance animal make sound sound electronic cicada
japan example cicada make incredible sound
sound electronic music incredible cicada okay fact surprise acknowledgement
fascination reality nothing wrong
try separate level fascination different level
level care sound come
sound sound sound
frog mean

also another play sound
interest producer room may
interest sample sound make music
problem

bunch money leave anybody

thank

haven money still money sample s
joke

two question ask first far
first experience record live nature sound rainforest
decide mind share people
develop crazy system blindfold people sit round
play experience

happen year step step final
configuration arrangement system blindfold
happen learn experience performance struggle also
possibility presentation always struggle
particularly music environment paradox also theater art
environment sometimes also term reconfiguration space
change rule much flexible music environment see
graphic equalizer control sound block lock couldn t
access club music understand
crazy struggle different restriction try
bring element little configuration
viable still evolve depend space start
able performance early quickly
try build element quickly early s

last question feel sound
transcendent spiritual sense ever interview
ask feel emotionally able spread
feel spiritual listen produce

definitely think hit important point spiritual
activity fundamentally religious person specific particular religion
sense definitely music sound general extremely powerful
force obviously connect entire history humankind
spiritual realm many different way potential
spiritual transformation whatever mean also see happen numb people performance numb sound installation strong
way definitely strong spiritual component yes

quite interest blindfold
fascinate numb time stop somewhere close
eye walk street notice
hometown tram winter snow audio
without resonance come hard surface normally
experience cool experience floatation tank
contact nod
work performance

try floatation tank three different place three
different system see impression extremely limit
possibility obviously soundsystems
soundsystems speaker crappy horrible sound terrible useless
experience happen every time re
drift float slowly slowly drift
float feel body
slowly drift half hour end touch side
chamber push little bite away side matter
time maybe half hour will touch end mind
basically busy idea try forget actual environment
environment good numb reason
also hear sound come outside somebody
aware sound hear come outside
numb limitation floatation tank think interest
aspect get body temperature
element will help go direction
element allow experience go much
bite disappoint experience

way extreme void input environment around
make aware also sensory everything else
sit blindfold

think commitment important commitment awareness try achieve course blindfold may feel
blindfold face sit
lay doesnmatter always aware
experience think crucial mood
intention intentional conscious active
meditation actively need learn
actively need practise require train effort equivalent sense
possible meditation anywhere anytime

start talk world reality see
explore reveal exist world record
sound manipulate point create entirely different
world access real reality create another real
reality

metaphor sculpture use formalready
material bring old idea actually
creation art always discussion
history creation suppose within entire big question
talk mean believe create
entirely new try substance reality
connect obviously term materiality material
use also connect term structure
important consider work field recording isnactually
people call sample sound sound
individual entity especially point view machine
machine sound constant flow sonic information
difference different individual entity try
say connection world try
work way representational doesnneed
representation aim representation therefore
separate life connect reality obviously aim creation
generate little life letput
way modest little new world create
connect course relate many different
aim generate little also aim
territory exploration other final
open gate territory way see way
try somebody else enter territory whether listener
someone experience sound responsibility person
create territory people believe mental
act creation come sound music produce sound s
listen sound creation act generate produce
finalize keep listen
creation sure try create blank territory
enter sense little different world explore go


creative act almost walk door

belief extent course objective door neutral couldn offer
particular subjective door will lead somewhere
territory point

thank

first piece play minute total believe
wonder interest concept vertical time non
lineartype music perhaps long session piece work

work structure generate combine sound
basically endless today generative whatever
endless installation show image
basically sound source endless depend time
installation

2 question slide screen briefly
bunch blindfold performer think see violinist pianist
guitarist perhaps wonder talk us

ensemble maarten altena ensemble amsterdam
work recently composition blindfold musician
play blindfold obviously score also visual
cue follow happen composition
improvise random work musician
time work composition make accord
possibility style way play
work term hide cue change sometimes radical change
music werenaudible audience unless piece
unless every single element happen
basically impossible turn whole
structure cue visual cue write cue bring cue
music audible musician piece will
change interest create
sudden change surprise change music contrast
important element composition
blindfold listen carefully

great thank

interest use spatialization place
center hear little audience hear
difficulty work spatializing sound generally speak center
sweet spot people sit outer edge will usually
bias speaker front performance method try
create overall even experience listener

center sweet spot music design way s
idea come less partly film soundsystems design
film focal point attention
around music idea move
around fix position anyway strategy live
performance design take place point
reference play play free sense
move around different way without single point
reference point listen reference term
hear move case sense
actual composition performance base ideal space
listen experience example recording multichannel
recording set way play happen
soundsystem never do fact flexible
move around space somebody sit edge
great listen experience person receive certain
point good listen people sit side
also apply even sound installation automaton
sound installation will single point
space will ideal case
installation example center center
good place listen depend performance
point good other work
case work piece design

couple three think

room five minute already answer variant
question apologize ear constantly search sound
find everyday situation example go
supermarket whereas us supermarket shop whereas
orchestra sound

sound film man xray vision end go crazy constant wave hand ear suggest constant noise thank god man position will go crazy
true many time unexpected situation place may
find nobody will notice will think irrelevant
oh incredible little sound typically s
little big notice little
little obvious musician
listen oh nice
suppose relate work sound carry
hour

great insight thought music make
process everything also interest thought music
make popular music term record performance
see see think
converge diverge music make

say bad make prediction every time make
prediction always wrong care make wrong prediction
impression today convergence term
mix cross rate different territory
definitely clear happen massive scale happen massive scale numb
year definitely crossbreed influence
go back forth see pop music example commercial music hear
today unthinkable year ago completely
unthinkable clear influence little little
detail music pop artist little
also another question go way around
people work experimental music today background
academic go study conservatory equivalent
background rock roll pop music wide sense background actually way aesthetic
direction idea sometimes flexibility sometimes speed
change completely different feed background
crucial view interest experimental
music do today do people without proper musical
train important mean quite fundamental
actually never happen history musicmaking
happen long time ago lose process perhaps re
recover stage thank paradoxical combination access
technology technology also socially today accept
anyone less doesnmean
successful less let time
live couldn will chance
present show whatever think important anything else mean middle massive social process change
hand anybody control direction definitely
see social process
definitely feel thank god music grip professional
musician composer

thank

talk early surprise unexpected
important element process get close real reality

sure unexpected many different manifestation different realm
find call real world unexpected
unexpected find unexpected be
world virtual world transformation
creation studio whatever find unexpected
world perhaps do exploration first
world 2 world always new
technological interest technology use
actually simple believe generate
technological change software example see change
sound definitely doesngo parallel change software
change software dramatic speed numb
numb possibility parameter range everything dramatic
brutal gigantic now term change sound
see much change limit hear s
limit numb go territory
sound mean
context place sound limitation
unexpected technical term come way
tweak unexpected maybe
somebody else interest short possible wonder
surprise find unexpected tool
use tool tool quite long
time now process happen unexpected still

thank

thank much francisco
