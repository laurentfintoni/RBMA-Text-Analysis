warm welcome mr new york lady gentleman

thank still like spin vinyl good see good last person screw record true

actually music maybe end record deal maybe actually man charge music sound good record radiohead justin timberlake britney spear everything girl man know radio everywhere sound good maybe tell us little bite job people come people general

close year enjoy cut vinyl people start say death vinyl come cut vinyl every year big lie people love vinyl love cut vinyl great format cool sound vinyl doesncome across point yet still voodoocraft people mainly machinery involve big frickin lathe cut material specialize type paint car paint piece metal basically lacquer master cool gig dance music guy dj mean great main source business work nice nice follow dj underground subtype label vinyl nice

say actually dance music especially techno early take independent label say save vinyl extend major production come vinyl anymore begin people switch cd independent small label still vinyl want hand dj

oh house underground definitely

think independent label keep alive much long

although major label always always do funny promos amaze single release jewel single will long frickin album many goddamn mix double vinyl minute remix track put general public doesnsee

regardless bring may cd say cassette also master cassette vinyl people bring start equipment look format people bring finish music make go pain enjoyment usually start project

get crazy now many different format people bring mp bring wavs bring split stereo file interweave stereo file mono file sd sd insane always try help people bring whatever master close finish mix keep bounce around convert change generation loss generation loss say digitally loss happen get file suppose stereo file slightly phase maybe two frame offset guy happen go fix

usually hear listen hear worry

call guy

tell people little bite perfect preparation job prepare master say cut tape

mean analog tape ideally sound good certain aspect understand possible numb costeffective numb two deal digitally sample necessarily mean great record great record actually sound great record bite sample little bad sound put together correctly still good record wouldn sample k master highres highres highres copy lowres record simple come do mix whether cd master dat keep close do give format take

say year obviously start bedroom production era everybody able sequencer plug everything set see increase quality material send around compression plug good still analog record

mean qualitywise definitely early day dedicate engineer make mix project generally good sound quality

bedroom production general suck

think people set arennecessarily familiar enough tool use maybe use optimally have use many preset dig around program see type whole step miss day guy start mix engineer watch old guy year

tell us little bite come engineer master important step mostly even

anymore miss step day lucky enough door good studio usually start slop toilet take trash get coffee whatever clean session wind cord low low bullshit first find serious hour week basically live also see guy also see signal path work signal path actually happen sound either guitar vocal way final tape big juggle act good sound tape mean process learn buy now set mix program way do may great record may sound close good sound familiar use line mean easy now pretty mix tool guy put steinberg actually look piece analog gear

letsay production home way fight way plugins maybe gear sly important compare sound alike important actually listen speaker home

important time new client especially say record dr dre record make record sound record sure happen dre people around put record together record sound goal system house put dre record dre record sound system try make mix sound close possible may crappy system home whole comparative ear tune specific sound mind may sub subsonic level crank low end tell little baby flumping around look enough low end actually record ohhhh whooowow way much familiarize hear bad record world come hit factory book day horrify hear great record come peoplebasements



individual

gear go buy gear experience

waste money

people anyway home fiddle around compression plugins deessing

l ultramaximizer

ultramaximizing

evil evil tool

make hard actually master guy people take much life suggest

never put twotrack compression mix make sound good let guy way problem need fix mix need bring bring headroom much easy sound much good almost people will ey finally square wave now rooooocks far truth whenever ask say put anything end worry loud last worry

loudness people important record may sound good put cd sound good bring three four notch sound mariah carey record whatever

process track job make loud

go dream go limitation format

mean ultimate deliver bite khz cd master unless go sacd superaudiocd even bite will convert format

actually worry loudness afterwards

process track eq compress whatever right dump workstation edit put need put punch volume

peak stand compression make sure nice flat

basically vu meter people use day far vu read peak modulation record zero vu plus minus whatever level put record record letsay plus five peak record transfer cd say basically limit add eight db gain plus eight zero cd basically far push competitive line people go mean horrify listen

software software keep red line

tool specifically design mean many record sit whole annoy sit minute music grind tooth

letsay afford give someone pay matter disrespect interest use l ultramaximizer

sure deliver record plant make use somebody

suggestion people proceed maybe crack wave plugins

see tough work entire analog console drop input level certain device overload along way little bite little bite little bite final may luxury pump chain

mean along eq drop certain frequency increase one

first input level console mix someone already scream hot drop input level console db start rebuild try fix whatever problem end unfortunately readd gain

master send terribly loud embarrass send quiet master take anyway



go track subtract let stand within add

depend cut may add engineer always add sometimes take away good deal time people way much scream khz roll right bat bring bass try fight whole check balance many year build card file sound good reference reference head work go okay type music think seem need

say bass mean talk studio compression obviously hard people bass right bass hard frequency

either fight kick fight bottom end

talk even use sub studio believe sub explain us

studio giant speaker adequate low end environment absolutely none mean hear think people tend fool sub set right accurate tune actually listen necessarily flat accurate hear everybody hear different

people afraid record club actually sub stand may sound scream midrange put enough sub master purpose try create mix work club little kitchen radio

see myth long do right will sound good anywhere say radio mix radio guy beat crap record anyway pretty much dead hit airwave fit crap little bandwidth airwave plus scream loud try mix will hear will super harsh people think need make bright gotta little lowend radio maybe true now

finish track home make good possible mackie mixer wherever always go listen different speaker car different size speaker

point relatively sound obviously difference shouldn huge difference issue boomboxes boomy mix make boombox boomy

weird question basically maybe ron murphy cut record right studio

lathe studio

analog

console use workstation use basically tape machine edit purpose assemble master cd need time now people deliver record either three different source sequence dump sequence cut
participant
good type format give stereo file

use pro tool file keep em link separate float around somewhere mean may supposedly find guy charge buck per hour cd do leave anything chance may end cd f have real easy slip stereo file load st file directly onto sonic solution system doesninterpret sound designer basically now stick two single file leave two right now align timewise guy hip right problem interleave stereo file screw

common letcall mistake draw people turn mix come big studio major production studio somebody home pin usual mistake people mechanical force medium also people mix vocal guitar usual mistake people make putting vocal high add many high

people different client couldnlisten drive insane client client service guy guy super stupid bright guy low end bright always personal taste obviously glare mistake say dude problem may able fix people vocal way hell

basically work stereo file people come eight file

do make sure make costprohibitive come often compilation deeelite dmitry brill member deeelite dmitry hadnfinished mix actually rent gear mix record master session

place

stupid money mean uff guess add spend much time fuck song work let letmove sit torture

describe bite process master people difference engineer master

first hopefully somebody trust last set ear listen make objective change record close record tough make informative decision may sound right extra trust set ear say alright probably fix little bite little bite weird unless actually putting vinyl super necessary step yet people think need obviously think help give now think need do make shine last bite spit polish

describe specifically radiohead album bring process

say lil kim record come jayz record three different remixers remix track three different guy three different place initially listen three say certain amount continuity since guy talk probably first step say alright need bring little bite close together flow type track may ultramaximized may may super stupid low end may nothing look reference head whatever listen sound good try adjust come reference point basically eq compressor basic deessers

use compressor overall track



good one though



basically chain go couple eq

actually compress eq afterwards will tend pump now compress eqed signal think easy compress flat signal need deal numb may add much eq hear miss track begin preference guy do now maybe next year change

ever time letsay hiphop artist artist bring music unmixed say master please share experience bring life feel oh unmixed

mean unmixed mean always twotrack form

twotrack stereo mean

oh time client alright

wouldncome suggestion

guy come session anymore mail deal master come studio even hear hear room every day guy use rather show sit couch eight hour pretty tire play sega golf game get old principle come basically mix place track

exactly equipment

maselec transfer console threepiece unit analog input input output converter analog gear go back input whatever source come whether tape whatever plug go console break bunch different section input section insert section output section different filter width control neat little gizmos analog maselec compressor sontec master eq another sontec split leftright parametric eq go another deesser analog peak limiter pretty much use cut vinyl use cd though go back converter convert whatever nonsense put make loud go ultramaximizer l everybody l

okay man pnice record right

yes free

master

yes mix end eq bring high little bite l l

ultramaximizer

right exactly since know wasn give someone master demo crank system
