earth stuff also go sub pop get paid reimburse contribute record cost yeah sure happen since earlygossip know role sub pop play year scene sort well local record label bruce john different bruce would say adventurous risk take side partnership jonathan business orient member partnership original relationship bruce sell part company warner brother bruce basically retire music start pursue interest yeah pretty much reason seattle even notice start first start put band like mudhoney stuff like paid fly journalist show especially english journalist take band australia stuff like really create whole scene make attractive major label always felt tangential like everything life two edge sword good bad grateful sub pop gotten chance put stuff thousand talented band never get although change production hand everyone grunge part whole thing lot people think bought record say sub pop expect something disappointed lot people would like buy saw sub pop expect something luckily wore morbid angel shirt back album metal fan sort first really embrace consistent metal fan great pay attention trend love love flat necessarily look flavor month whatever definitely really good core audience maybe listen track first album actually come sub pop seven angel earth music earth seven angel minute long yeah fade know time write record listen also read stuff la monte young put right reading la monte young find music much difficult luckily gramavision insane reason like new age label time put box set well tune piano like five lp think something like put cd b flat blue band call mostly reading la monte young concept guess found like probably people velvet underground terry reilly form band guess listen time would combination king crimson slayer minimalist composer say mean love kind music guess conceptually strong influence guess first start sat play guitar instead stand bit adolescent trip worship yeah mean grow expose lot music parent born product summer love guess could say parent music stuff since young u discover music able buy record gravitate ac dc start hearing get music want play music rock roll star yeah always thought would hear song cool riff cool part song always like oh would like stayed instead move next part read minimalism stuff like like oh take slayer style riff play minute half speed guess could say one good idea recognize ran later discover indian music stuff like know maybe since scottish heritage sort atavistic bagpipe thing always drawn stuff repetitive slow side tempo kind yeah yeah earth sort come earth conceptual early day wonderful new invention cd open time however long minute know longer time length like oh let fill entire cd one song three part obviously tape contribute get minute max record tape back sort splice fade fade stuff like whereas nowadays pro tool could conceivably make endless record john cage piece year john cage piece call year yeah guess case know church germany think hour south new tone every two three year announce usually go see say conceptual early year talk la monte young indian music conceptual come scale tune well la monte young indian music never intonation anything like always work standard guitar later company start make fretless guitar intonate fret board kind stuff sort move always like go work regular guitar back use tune much low realize hendrix e flat defy anyone come heavier riff tony iommi drop whole step use thinnest string finger low guitar tune many seven eight nine string whole kind earth sort response time everyone try fast band earth like oh go slow take something like make focus like turn music sport like oh band oh slowest band low tune band like forget music originally thing pay attention music worry something else know much composition strategy listen instrument well think listen instrument like symbiotic relationship hopefully maybe would say parasitic ultimately able transfer come listen wherever music come come people take form come people certain instrument like listen guess goal obviously able transcend whatever instrument play time make deliver music effectively possible kind ask know say quite like idea play different note basically play drone allows listen happen inside one note yeah way human ear built overtone series begin create melody technically note produce like artificial tonic analyze frequency analyzer whatever use kind stuff yeah human ear produce melody response overtone series produce think everything universe vibrate quantum mechanic show u basically everything wave form even particle actually wave form string theory vibrate string whatever everything vibrational energy make sense make music drawn music affect u like vibrates u physically molecular level musical instrument played well sound vibration organize molecule instrument whereas instrument lock away enshrine usually sound horrible played meant put museum shut away hoard stuff talk would kind assume would go intonation right maybe explain basically way intonate instrument note base ratio number little thing call pythagorean interval mess everything basically conventional western music call equal temperament take divide amongst note note scale intonation system do different way like arabic persian scale quarter tone stuff like way deal mostly guess like move make music instrument prohibitively expensive really see need mean move mean kept mean still love open string call oblique motion drone basically simplest form simplest form oblique motion one note go whilst note move perfectly able conventional instrument thing conventional instrument intonate instrument um yeah oblique motion thing could show one guitar yeah pretty simple like simple thing thing might simple still need play guitar yeah guess like oblique motion e constantly go play note move know like lot metal oblique motion like open string know inaudible broken example oblique motion play guitar thanks applause fast version song finger finger year fine mean early career one carpel tunnel syndrome operation left wrist problem since mean play strong finger get unless unfortunate accident strain know somehow mess luckily manage avoid think listen

play plan restart earth even band play live record want play guitar start drum met adrienne start play together eventually sort morph music period call therapy music actually start write even though never want make album always never understood mentality like album represent specific period time specific set circumstance recreate really point try recreate guess lot people successful album think oh get formula repeat ad nauseam coldplay laugh never thought way grow change musician want grow change record artist different thing try different concept record always important song arc album also arc every album different different set circumstance period time preserve kind unlike live experience like moment time never repeat preserve luxury get go record studio work stuff time try best work something different experiment album come hex say introduce adrian say met adrienne davy played drum couple album change work drummer earth first time work drummer pentastar make life easy respect program drum machine anymore obviously work another musician contribute something work drummer two band earth strange never oppose drummer always difficult find one let maybe put differently mention consonance dissonance especially dual setup adrienne would ever approach dual setup one person dissonant one one consonant one aim resolution everyone drum melodic different way guitar cello whatever rhythmic sometimes time keep sometimes timbre color instrument add something hold thing together guess way look drum consonant dissonant thing unless tune percussion like say tabla melodic tune cymbal bell stuff like melodic harmonic like vibraphone something drum consider way start tour think even russell haswell set early tour right yeah start tour around time feed back track make begin write lot stuff tour work song live situation introduce song live situation always play new stuff tour well stuff album tour always new stuff play next album hopefully big change write home record show stuff audience finish another double album angel darkness demon light want listen track want listen track think specifically improvised compose old black music earth old black could let run forever say compose track maybe want explain specific session would move one compose track opener arc album compose compose track open record end track completely improvised studio arc session compose old black write sometimes set little job try something do specific song oh go write minor key want traditional structure ababc believe come verse chorus verse chorus outro song originate guess could say yeah sort little task set songwriting like say angel darkness album record time album much one record kind come liver failure diagnose hepatitis b wild type book two week tour wolf throne room go studio afterward sure go earth turn productive session lot material especially improvise credit lori goldston help amaze cello player amaze musician period probably formidable musician around musician know would say talk album arc arc project co compose song work tour wolf would also improvise quite bit every night mean improvise part sort start bee make honey album listen lot jazz stuff guess self confess dead head one thing always love grateful dead improvisatory nature fact none live show none song night night way look live thing never understood concept like oh go try recreate album stage mean would go mad would drive crazy also fact want hear record play record record put record lip sync pretend play want recreate live night night whereas always thought live mean love live experience always different different every night even play song different every night always try leave well especially since bee album always try leave moment improvisation possible require co excite live thing like audience come together create moment never happen song never played way opening music let music dictate happen would compositional task challenge set maybe even would suggest people set specific one never suggest people like say bulk songwriting songwriting even improvisatory track usually come riff whatever go use exception angel darkness demon light track like roll tape know start play know usually stuff like oh try something like conventional song write call conventional songwriting try structure know like something recognize way something guess guess would want try piece piece evoke want quiet piece stuff mean really make like task head bit guess lot people songwriting another album primitive deadly think first conceive part first conceive solo project talk solo project talk albion think maybe mostly german room people would know albion stand albion old name england also name connotes mythic britain magical britain original name island white alba latin white cliff dover
